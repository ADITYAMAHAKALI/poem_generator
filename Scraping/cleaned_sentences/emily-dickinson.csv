8,1,it always felt to me—a wrong
9,1,to that old moses—done—
10,1,to let him see—the canaan—
11,1,without the entering—
12,1,and tho' in soberer moments—
13,1,no moses there can be
14,1,i'm satisfied—the romance
15,1,in point of injury—
16,1,surpasses sharper stated—
17,1,of stephen—or of paul—
18,1,for these—were only put to death—
19,1,while god's adroiter will
20,1,on moses—seemed to fasten
21,1,with tantalizing play

23,1,to prove ability.
24,1,the fault—was doubtless israel's—
25,1,myself—had banned the tribes—

37,2,how have i peace

44,3,my faith is larger than the hills—
45,3,so when the hills decay—

52,3,and if his yellow feet should miss—
53,3,the bird would not arise—
54,3,the flowers would slumber on their stems—
55,3,no bells have paradise—
56,3,"how dare i, therefore, stint a faith"
57,3,on which so vast depends—
58,3,lest firmament should fail for me—
59,3,the rivet in the bands
60,4,no romance sold unto

78,6,we talked as girls do—
79,6,"fond, and late—"
80,6,"we speculated fair, on every subject, but the grave—"
81,6,"of ours, none affair—"
82,6,"we handled destinies, as cool—"
83,6,as we—disposers—be—

90,6,we parted with a contract
91,6,"to cherish, and to write"
92,6,"but heaven made both, impossible"
93,6,before another night.
94,7,'tis anguish grander than delight
95,7,'tis resurrection pain—
96,7,the meeting bands of smitten face
97,7,"we questioned to, again."
98,7,'tis transport wild as thrills the graves
99,7,when cerements let go

101,7,go up by two and two.
102,8,'tis customary as we part
103,8,a trinket—to confer—
104,8,it helps to stimulate the faith
105,8,when lovers be afar—
106,8,'tis various—as the various taste—
107,8,clematis—journeying far—
108,8,presents me with a single curl
109,8,of her electric hair—
110,9,'tis little i—could care for pearls—
111,9,who own the ample sea—
112,9,or brooches—when the emperor—
113,9,with rubies—pelteth me—
114,9,or gold—who am the prince of mines—
115,9,or diamonds—when have i
116,9,a diadem to fit a dom—
117,9,continual upon me—
118,10,'tis not that dying hurts us so—
119,10,'tis living—hurts us more—
120,10,but dying—is a different way—
121,10,a kind behind the door—
122,10,the southern custom—of the bird—
123,10,that ere the frosts are due—
124,10,accepts a better latitude—
125,10,we—are the birds—that stay.
126,10,the shrivers round farmers' doors—
127,10,for whose reluctant crumb—
128,10,we stipulate—till pitying snows
129,10,persuade our feathers home.
130,11,'tis one by one—the father counts—
131,11,and then a tract between
132,11,set cypherless—to teach the eye
133,11,the value of its ten—
134,11,until the peevish student
135,11,acquire the quick of skill—
136,11,then numerals are dowered back—
137,11,adorning all the rule—
138,11,'tis mostly slate and pencil—
139,11,and darkness on the school
140,11,distracts the children's fingers—
141,11,still the eternal rule
142,11,regards least cypherer alike
143,11,with leader of the band—
144,11,and every separate urchin's sum—
145,11,is fashioned for his hand—
146,12,'tis opposites—entice—
147,12,deformed men—ponder grace—
148,12,bright fires—the blanketless—

150,12,the blind—esteem it be
151,12,enough estate—to see—
152,12,the captive—strangles new—
153,12,for deeming—beggars—play—
154,12,to lack—enamor thee—
155,12,tho' the divinity—
156,12,be only
157,12,me—
158,13,'tis so appalling—it exhilarates—
159,13,"so over horror, it half captivates—"
160,13,"the soul stares after it, secure—"
161,13,"a sepulchre, fears frost, no more—"
162,13,"to scan a ghost, is faint—"
163,13,"but grappling, conquers it—"
164,13,"how easy, torment, now—"
165,13,suspense kept sawing so—
166,13,"the truth, is bald, and cold—"
167,13,but that will hold—
168,13,if any are not sure—
169,13,we show them—prayer—
170,13,"but we, who know,"
171,13,"stop hoping, now—"
172,13,"looking at death, is dying—"
173,13,just let go the breath—
174,13,and not the pillow at your cheek
175,13,so slumbereth—
176,13,"others, can wrestle—"
177,13,"yours, is done—"
178,13,"and so of woe, bleak dreaded—come,"
179,13,it sets the fright at liberty—
180,13,and terror's free—
181,13,"gay, ghastly, holiday!"
182,14,'tis so much joy! 'tis so much joy!
183,14,"if i should fail, what poverty!"
184,14,"and yet, as poor as i,"
185,14,have ventured all upon a throw!
186,14,have gained! yes! hesitated so—
187,14,this side the victory!
188,14,"life is but life! and death, but death!"
189,14,"bliss is, but bliss, and breath but breath!"
190,14,"and if indeed i fail,"
191,14,"at least, to know the worst, is sweet!"
192,14,"defeat means nothing but defeat,"
193,14,"no drearier, can befall!"
194,14,and if i gain! oh gun at sea!
195,14,"oh bells, that in the steeples be!"
196,14,"at first, repeat it slow!"
197,14,"for heaven is a different thing,"
198,14,"conjectured, and waked sudden in—"
199,14,and might extinguish me!
200,15,'tis sunrise—little maid—hast thou
201,15,no station in the day?
202,15,"'twas not thy wont, to hinder so—"
203,15,retrieve thine industry—
204,15,'tis noon—my little maid—
205,15,alas—and art thou sleeping yet?
206,15,the lily—waiting to be wed—
207,15,the bee—hast thou forgot?
208,15,my little maid—'tis night—alas
209,15,that night should be to thee
210,15,instead of morning—had'st thou broached
211,15,thy little plan to die—
212,15,"dissuade thee, if i could not, sweet,"
213,15,i might have aided—thee—
214,16,'tis true—they shut me in the cold—
215,16,but then—themselves were warm
216,16,and could not know the feeling 'twas—
217,16,forget it—lord—of them—
218,16,let not my witness hinder them
219,16,in heavenly esteem—
220,16,no paradise could be—conferred
221,16,through their beloved blame—
222,16,the harm they did—was short—and since
223,16,myself—who bore it—do—
224,16,forgive them—even as myself—
225,16,or else—forgive not me—
226,17,'twas a long parting—but the time
227,17,for interview—had come—
228,17,before the judgment seat of god—
229,17,the last—and second time
230,17,these fleshless lovers met—
231,17,a heaven in a gaze—
232,17,a heaven of heavens—the privilege
233,17,of one another's eyes—
234,17,no lifetime—on them—
235,17,appareled as the new
236,17,unborn—except they had beheld—
237,17,born infiniter—now—
238,17,was bridal—e'er like this?
239,17,a paradise—the host—
240,17,and cherubim—and seraphim—
241,17,the unobtrusive guest—
242,18,"'twas awkward, but it fitted me—"
243,18,an ancient fashioned heart—
244,18,its only lore—its steadfastness—
245,18,in change—unerudite—
246,18,it only moved as do the suns—
247,18,for merit of return—
248,18,or birds—confirmed perpetual
249,18,by alternating zone—
250,18,i only have it not tonight
251,18,in its established place—
252,18,for technicality of death—
253,18,omitted in the lease—
254,19,"'twas just this time, last year, i died."
255,19,"i know i heard the corn,"
256,19,when i was carried by the farms—
257,19,it had the tassels on—
258,19,i thought how yellow it would look—
259,19,when richard went to mill—
260,19,"and then, i wanted to get out,"
261,19,but something held my will.
262,19,i thought just how red—apples wedged
263,19,the stubble's joints between—
264,19,and the carts stooping round the fields
265,19,to take the pumpkins in—
266,19,"i wondered which would miss me, least,"
267,19,"and when thanksgiving, came,"
268,19,if father'd multiply the plates—
269,19,to make an even sum—
270,19,and would it blur the christmas glee
271,19,my stocking hang too high
272,19,for any santa claus to reach
273,19,the altitude of me—
274,19,"but this sort, grieved myself,"
275,19,"and so, i thought the other way,"
276,19,"how just this time, some perfect year—"
277,19,"themself, should come to me—"
278,20,"'twas like a maelstrom, with a notch,"
279,20,"that nearer, every day,"
280,20,kept narrowing its boiling wheel
281,20,until the agony
282,20,toyed coolly with the final inch
283,20,of your delirious hem—
284,20,"and you dropt, lost,"
285,20,when something broke—
286,20,and let you from a dream—
287,20,as if a goblin with a gauge—
288,20,kept measuring the hours—
289,20,until you felt your second
290,20,"weigh, helpless, in his paws—"
291,20,"and not a sinew—stirred—could help,"
292,20,and sense was setting numb—
293,20,when god—remembered—and the fiend
294,20,"let go, then, overcome—"
295,20,as if your sentence stood—pronounced—
296,20,and you were frozen led
297,20,from dungeon's luxury of doubt
298,20,"to gibbets, and the dead—"
299,20,and when the film had stitched your eyes
300,20,"a creature gasped ""reprieve""!"
301,20,which anguish was the utterest—then—
302,20,"to perish, or to live?"
303,21,'twas love—not me—
304,21,oh punish—pray—
305,21,the real one died for thee—
306,21,just him—not me—
307,21,such guilt—to love thee—most!
308,21,doom it beyond the rest—
309,21,forgive it—last—
310,21,'twas base as jesus—most!
311,21,let justice not mistake—
312,21,we two—looked so alike—
313,21,which was the guilty sake—
314,21,'twas love's—now strike!
315,22,'twas the old—road—through pain—
316,22,that unfrequented—one—
317,22,with many a turn—and thorn—
318,22,that stops—at heaven—
319,22,this—was the town—she passed—
320,22,there—where she—rested—last—
321,22,then—stepped more fast—
322,22,the little tracks—close prest—
323,22,then—not so swift—
324,22,slow—slow—as feet did weary—grow—
325,22,then—stopped—no other track!
326,22,wait! look! her little book—
327,22,the leaf—at love—turned back—
328,22,her very hat—
329,22,and this worn shoe just fits the track—
330,22,herself—though—fled!
331,22,another bed—a short one—
332,22,women make—tonight—
333,22,in chambers bright—
334,22,too out of sight—though—
335,22,for our hoarse good night—
336,22,to touch her head!
337,23,'twas warm—at first—like us—
338,23,until there crept upon
339,23,a chill—like frost upon a glass—
340,23,till all the scene—be gone.
341,23,the forehead copied stone—
342,23,the fingers grew too cold
343,23,to ache—and like a skater's brook—
344,23,the busy eyes—congealed—
345,23,it straightened—that was all—
346,23,it crowded cold to cold—
347,23,it multiplied indifference—
348,23,as pride were all it could—
349,23,and even when with cords—
350,23,"'twas lowered, like a weight—"
351,23,"it made no signal, nor demurred,"
352,23,but dropped like adamant.
353,24,'twould ease—a butterfly—
354,24,elate—a bee—
355,24,thou'rt neither—
356,24,neither—thy capacity—
357,24,"but, blossom, were i,"
358,24,i would rather be
359,24,thy moment
360,24,than a bee's eternity—
361,24,content of fading
362,24,is enough for me—
363,24,fade i unto divinity—
364,24,and dying—lifetime—
365,24,ample as the eye—
366,24,her least attention raise on me—
367,25,"a bird came down the walk,"
368,25,he did not know i saw;
369,25,he bit an angle-worm in halves
370,25,"and ate the fellow, raw."
371,25,and then he drank a dew
372,25,"from a convenient grass,"
373,25,and then hopped sidewise to the wall
374,25,to let a beetle pass.
375,25,he glanced with rapid eyes
376,25,"that hurried all abroad, "
377,25,"they looked like frightened beads, i thought;"
378,25,he stirred his velvet head
379,25,"like one in danger; cautious,"
380,25,"i offered him a crumb,"
381,25,and he unrolled his feathers
382,25,and rowed him softer home
383,25,"than oars divide the ocean,"
384,25,"too silver for a seam,"
385,25,"or butterflies, off banks of noon,"
386,25,"leap, splashless, as they swim."
387,26,there is no frigate like a book
388,26,"to take us lands away,"
389,26,nor any coursers like a page
390,26,of prancing poetry.
391,26,this traverse may the poorest take
392,26,without oppress of toll;
393,26,how frugal is the chariot
394,26,that bears a human soul!
395,27,a burdock—clawed my gown—
396,27,not burdock's—blame—
397,27,but mine—
398,27,who went too near
399,27,the burdock's den—
400,27,a bog—affronts my shoe—
401,27,what else have bogs—to do—
402,27,the only trade they know—
403,27,the splashing men!
404,27,"ah, pity—then!"
405,27,'tis minnows can despise!
406,27,the elephant's—calm eyes
407,27,look further on!
408,28,a charm invests a face
409,28,imperfectly beheld—
410,28,the lady date not lift her veil
411,28,for fear it be dispelled—
412,28,but peers beyond her mesh—
413,28,and wishes—and denies—
414,28,lest interview—annul a want
415,28,that image—satisfies—
416,29,a clock stopped   not the mantel's
417,29,  geneva's farthest skill
418,29,can't put the puppet bowing
419,29,  that just now dangled still.
420,29,an awe came on the trinket!
421,29,"  the figures hunched with pain,"
422,29,then quivered out of decimals
423,29,  into degreeless noon.
424,29,"it will not stir for doctors,"
425,29,  this pendulum of snow;
426,29,"the shopman importunes it,"
427,29,"  while cool, concernless no"
428,29,"nods from the gilded pointers,"
429,29,"  nods from seconds slim,"
430,29,decades of arrogance between
431,29,  the dial life and him.
432,30,a cloud withdrew from the sky
433,30,superior glory be
434,30,but that cloud and its auxiliaries
435,30,are forever lost to me
436,30,had i but further scanned
437,30,had i secured the glow
438,30,in an hermetic memory
439,30,it had availed me now.
440,30,never to pass the angel
441,30,with a glance and a bow
442,30,till i am firm in heaven
443,30,is my intention now.
444,31,"a coffin—is a small domain,"
445,31,yet able to contain
446,31,a citizen of paradise
447,31,in it diminished plane.
448,31,a grave—is a restricted breadth—
449,31,yet ampler than the sun—
450,31,and all the seas he populates
451,31,and lands he looks upon
452,31,to him who on its small repose
453,31,bestows a single friend—
454,31,circumference without relief—
455,31,or estimate—or end—
456,32,a darting fear—a pomp—a tear—
457,32,a waking on a morn
458,32,"to find that what one waked for,"
459,32,inhales the different dawn.
460,33,a day! help! help! another day!
461,33,"your prayers, oh passer by!"
462,33,from such a common ball as this
463,33,might date a victory!
464,33,from marshallings as simple
465,33,the flags of nations swang.
466,33,"steady—my soul, what issues"
467,33,upon thine arrow hang!
468,34,a death blow is a life blow to some
469,34,"who till they died, did not alive become—"
470,34,"who had they lived, had died but when"
471,34,"they died, vitality begun."
472,35,a door just opened on a street 
473,35,"  i, lost, was passing by "
474,35,an instant's width of warmth disclosed
475,35,"  and wealth, and company."
476,35,"the door as sudden shut, and i,"
477,35,"  i, lost, was passing by, "
478,35,"lost doubly, but by contrast most,"
479,35,  enlightening misery.
480,36,a doubt if it be us
481,36,assists the staggering mind
482,36,in an extremer anguish
483,36,until it footing find.
484,36,"an unreality is lent,"
485,36,a merciful mirage
486,36,that makes the living possible
487,36,while it suspends the lives.
488,37,a drop fell on the apple tree
489,37,another on the roof;
490,37,"a half a dozen kissed the eaves,"
491,37,and made the gables laugh.
492,37,"a few went out to help the brook,"
493,37,that went to help the sea.
494,37,"myself conjectured, were they pearls,"
495,37,what necklaces could be!
496,37,the dust replaced in hoisted roa
497,37,the birds jocoser sung;
498,37,"the sunshine threw his hat away,"
499,37,the orchards spangles hung.
500,37,the breezes brought dejected
501,37,and bathed them in the glee;
502,37,"the east put out a single flag,"
503,37,and signed the fete away.
504,38,a dying tiger—moaned for drink—
505,38,i hunted all the sand—
506,38,i caught the dripping of a rock
507,38,and bore it in my hand—
508,38,his mighty balls—in death were thick—
509,38,but searching—i could see
510,38,a vision on the retina
511,38,of water—and of me—
512,38,'twas not my blame—who sped too slow—
513,38,'twas not his blame—who died
514,38,while i was reaching him—
515,38,but 'twas—the fact that he was dead—
516,39,a feather from the whippoorwill
517,39,that everlasting—sings!
518,39,whose galleries—are sunrise—
519,39,whose opera—the springs—
520,39,whose emerald nest the ages spin
521,39,of mellow—murmuring thread—
522,39,"whose beryl egg, what schoolboys hunt"
523,39,"in ""recess""—overhead!"
524,40,a first mute coming—
525,40,in the stranger's house—
526,40,a first fair going—
527,40,when the bells rejoice—
528,40,a first exchange—of
529,40,what hath mingled—been—
530,40,for lot—exhibited to
531,40,faith—alone—
532,41,"a fuzzy fellow, without feet,"
533,41,yet doth exceeding run!
534,41,"of velvet, is his countenance,"
535,41,"and his complexion, dun!"
536,41,"sometime, he dwelleth in the grass!"
537,41,"sometime, upon a bough,"
538,41,from which he doth descend in plush
539,41,upon the passer-by!
540,41,all this in summer.
541,41,"but when winds alarm the forest folk,"
542,41,he taketh damask residence—
543,41,and struts in sewing silk!
544,41,"then, finer than a lady,"
545,41,emerges in the spring!
546,41,a feather on each shoulder!
547,41,you'd scarce recognize him!
548,41,"by men, yclept caterpillar!"
549,41,"by me! but who am i,"
550,41,to tell the pretty secret
551,41,of the butterfly!
552,42,a happy lip—breaks sudden—
553,42,it doesn't state you how
554,42,it contemplated—smiling—
555,42,just consummated—now—
556,42,"but this one, wears its merriment"
557,42,so patient—like a pain—
558,42,fresh gilded—to elude the eyes
559,42,"unqualified, to scan—"
560,43,a house upon the height—
561,43,that wagon never reached—
562,43,"no dead, were ever carried down—"
563,43,no peddler's cart—approached—
564,43,whose chimney never smoked—
565,43,whose windows—night and morn—
566,43,caught sunrise first—and sunset—last—
567,43,then—held an empty pane—
568,43,whose fate—conjecture knew—
569,43,no other neighbor—did—
570,43,and what it was—we never lisped—
571,43,because he—never told—
572,44,a lady red—amid the hill
573,44,her annual secret keeps!
574,44,"a lady white, within the field"
575,44,in placid lily sleeps!
576,44,"the tidy breezes, with their brooms—"
577,44,sweep vale—and hill—and tree!
578,44,"prithee, my pretty housewives!"
579,44,who may expected be?
580,44,the neighbors do not yet suspect!
581,44,the woods exchange a smile!
582,44,"orchard, and buttercup, and bird—"
583,44,in such a little while!
584,44,"and yet, how still the landscape stands!"
585,44,how nonchalant the hedge!
586,44,"as if the ""resurrection"""
587,44,were nothing very strange!
588,45,a light exists in spring
589,45,  not present on the year
590,45,at any other period.
591,45,  when march is scarcely here
592,45,a color stands abroad
593,45,  on solitary hills
594,45,"that science cannot overtake,"
595,45,  but human naturefeels.
596,45,it waits upon the lawn;
597,45,  it shows the furthest tree
598,45,upon the furthest slope we know;
599,45,  it almost speaks to me.
600,45,"then, as horizons step,"
601,45,"  or noons report away,"
602,45,"without the formula of sound,"
603,45,"  it passes, and we stay,"
604,45,a quality of loss
605,45,"  affecting our content,"
606,45,as trade had suddenly encroached
607,45,  upon a sacrament.
608,46,a little bread—a crust—a crumb—
609,46,a little trust—a demijohn—
610,46,can keep the soul alive—
611,46,"not portly, mind! but breathing—warm—"
612,46,"conscious—as old napoleon,"
613,46,the night before the crown!
614,46,a modest lot—a fame petite—
615,46,a brief campaign of sting and sweet
616,46,is plenty! is enough!
617,46,a sailor's business is the shore!
618,46,"a soldier's—balls! who asketh more,"
619,46,must seek the neighboring life!
620,47,"a little east of jordan,"
621,47,"   evangelists record,"
622,47,   a gymnast and an angel
623,47,"   did wrestle long and hard,"
624,47,   till morning touching mountain 
625,47,"   and jacob, waxing strong,"
626,47,   the angel begged permission
627,47,   to breakfast to return.
628,47,"   ""not so,"" said cunning jacob!"
629,47,"  ""i will not let thee go"
630,47,"  except thou bless me"" stranger!"
631,47,"  the which acceded to,"
632,47,  light swung the silver fleeces
633,47,"  ""peniel"" hills beyond,"
634,47,  and the bewildered gymnast
635,47,  found he had worsted god!
636,48,a little road—not made of man—
637,48,enabled of the eye—
638,48,accessible to thill of bee—
639,48,or cart of butterfly—
640,48,if town it have—beyond itself—
641,48,'tis that—i cannot say—
642,48,i only know—no curricle that rumble there
643,48,bear me—
644,49,"a long, long sleep, a famous sleep"
645,49,that makes no show for dawn
646,49,"by stretch of limb or stir of lid,  "
647,49,an independent one.
648,49,was ever idleness like this?
649,49,within a hut of stone
650,49,to bask the centuries away
651,49,nor once look up for noon?
652,50,a loss of something ever felt i—
653,50,the first that i could recollect
654,50,bereft i was—of what i knew not
655,50,too young that any should suspect
656,50,a mourner walked among the children
657,50,i notwithstanding went about
658,50,as one bemoaning a dominion
659,50,itself the only prince cast out—
660,50,"elder, today, a session wiser"
661,50,"and fainter, too, as wiseness is—"
662,50,i find myself still softly searching
663,50,for my delinguent palaces—
664,50,"and a suspicion, like a finger"
665,50,touches my forehead now and then
666,50,that i am looking oppositely
667,50,for the site of the kingdom of heaven—
668,51,a man may make a remark—
669,51,in itself—a quiet thing
670,51,that may furnish the fuse unto a spark
671,51,in dormant nature—lain—
672,51,let us deport—with skill—
673,51,let us discourse—with care—
674,51,powder exists in charcoal—
675,51,before it exists in fire.
676,52,a mien to move a queen—
677,52,half child—half heroine—
678,52,an orleans in the eye
679,52,that puts its manner by
680,52,for humbler company
681,52,when none are near
682,52,even a tear—
683,52,its frequent visitor—
684,52,a bonnet like a duke—
685,52,and yet a wren's peruke
686,52,were not so shy
687,52,of goer by—
688,52,and hands—so slight—
689,52,they would elate a sprite
690,52,with merriment—
691,52,a voice that alters—low
692,52,and on the ear can go
693,52,like let of snow—
694,52,or shift supreme—
695,52,as tone of realm
696,52,on subjects diadem—
697,52,too small—to fear—
698,52,too distant—to endear—
699,52,and so men compromise
700,52,and just—revere—
701,53,a moth the hue of this
702,53,haunts candles in brazil.
703,53,nature's experience would make
704,53,our reddest second pale.
705,53,"nature is fond, i sometimes think,"
706,53,"of trinkets, as a girl."
707,54,a murmur in the trees—to note—
708,54,not loud enough—for wind—
709,54,a star—not far enough to seek—
710,54,nor near enough—to find—
711,54,a long—long yellow—on the lawn—
712,54,a hubbub—as of feet—
713,54,not audible—as ours—to us—
714,54,but dapperer—more sweet—
715,54,a hurrying home of little men
716,54,to houses unperceived—
717,54,all this—and more—if i should tell—
718,54,would never be believed—
719,54,of robins in the trundle bed
720,54,how many i espy
721,54,whose nightgowns could not hide the wings—
722,54,although i heard them try—
723,54,but then i promised ne'er to tell—
724,54,how could i break my word?
725,54,so go your way—and i'll go mine—
726,54,no fear you'll miss the road.
727,55,a narrow fellow in the grass
728,55,occasionally rides;
729,55,"you may have met him, did you not,"
730,55,his notice sudden is.
731,55,"the grass divides as with a comb,"
732,55,a spotted shaft is seen;
733,55,and then it closes at your feet
734,55,and opens further on.
735,55,"he likes a boggy acre,"
736,55,a floor too cool for corn.
737,55,"yet when a child, and barefoot,"
738,55,"i more than once, at morn,"
739,55,"have passed, i thought, a whip-lash"
740,55,"unbraiding in the sun, "
741,55,"when, stooping to secure it,"
742,55,"it wrinkled, and was gone."
743,55,several of nature's people
744,55,"i know, and they know me;"
745,55,i feel for them a transport
746,55,of cordiality;
747,55,"but never met this fellow,"
748,55,"attended or alone,"
749,55,"without a tighter breathing,"
750,55,and zero at the bone.
751,56,a nearness to tremendousness—
752,56,an agony procures—
753,56,affliction ranges boundlessness—
754,56,vicinity to laws
755,56,contentment's quiet suburb—
756,56,affliction cannot stay
757,56,in acres—its location
758,56,is illocality—
759,57,a night—there lay the days between—
760,57,the day that was before—
761,57,and day that was behind—were one—
762,57,and now—'twas night—was here—
763,57,slow—night—that must be watched away—
764,57,as grains upon a shore—
765,57,too imperceptible to note—
766,57,till it be night—no more—
767,58,a planted life—diversified
768,58,with gold and silver pain
769,58,to prove the presence of the ore
770,58,in particles—'tis when
771,58,a value struggle—it exist—
772,58,a power—will proclaim
773,58,although annihilation pile
774,58,whole chaoses on him—
775,59,a poor—torn heart—a tattered heart—
776,59,that sat it down to rest—
777,59,nor noticed that the ebbing day
778,59,flowed silver to the west—
779,59,nor noticed night did soft descend—
780,59,nor constellation burn—
781,59,intent upon the vision
782,59,of latitudes unknown.
783,59,the angels—happening that way
784,59,this dusty heart espied—
785,59,tenderly took it up from toil
786,59,and carried it to god—
787,59,there—sandals for the barefoot—
788,59,there—gathered from the gales—
789,59,do the blue havens by the hand
790,59,lead the wandering sails.
791,60,a precious—mouldering pleasure—'tis—
792,60,to meet an antique book—
793,60,in just the dress his century wore—
794,60,a privilege—i think—
795,60,his venerable hand to take—
796,60,and warming in our own—
797,60,a passage back—or two—to make—
798,60,to times when he—was young—
799,60,his quaint opinions—to inspect—
800,60,his thought to ascertain
801,60,on themes concern our mutual mind—
802,60,the literature of man—
803,60,what interested scholars—most—
804,60,what competitions ran—
805,60,when plato—was a certainty—
806,60,and sophocles—a man—
807,60,when sappho—was a living girl—
808,60,and beatrice wore
809,60,the gown that dante—deified—
810,60,facts centuries before
811,60,he traverses—familiar—
812,60,as one should come to town—
813,60,and tell you all your dreams—were true—
814,60,he lived—where dreams were born—
815,60,his presence is enchantment—
816,60,you beg him not to go—
817,60,old volume shake their vellum heads
818,60,and tantalize—just so—
819,61,a prison gets to be a friend—
820,61,between its ponderous face
821,61,and ours—a kinsmanship express—
822,61,and in its narrow eyes—
823,61,we come to look with gratitude
824,61,for the appointed beam
825,61,it deal us—stated as our food—
826,61,and hungered for—the same—
827,61,we learn to know the planks—
828,61,that answer to our feet—
829,61,so miserable a sound—at first—
830,61,nor ever now—so sweet—
831,61,as plashing in the pools—
832,61,when memory was a boy—
833,61,but a demurer circuit—
834,61,a geometric joy—
835,61,the posture of the key
836,61,that interrupt the day
837,61,to our endeavor—not so real
838,61,the check of liberty—
839,61,as this phantasm steel—
840,61,whose features—day and night—
841,61,are present to us—as our own—
842,61,and as escapeless—quite—
843,61,the narrow round—the stint—
844,61,the slow exchange of hope—
845,61,for something passiver—content
846,61,too steep for lookinp up—
847,61,the liberty we knew
848,61,avoided—like a dream—
849,61,too wide for any night but heaven—
850,61,if that—indeed—redeem—
851,62,a route of evanescence
852,62,with a revolving wheel 
853,62,a resonance of emerald 
854,62,a rush of cochineal 
855,62,and every blossom on the bush
856,62,adjusts its tumbled head 
857,62,"the mail from tunis, probably,"
858,62,an easy morning's ride 
859,63,"a science—so the savants say,"
860,63,"""comparative anatomy""—"
861,63,by which a single bone—
862,63,is made a secret to unfold
863,63,"of some rare tenant of the mold,"
864,63,else perished in the stone—
865,63,"so to the eye prospective led,"
866,63,this meekest flower of the mead
867,63,"upon a winter's day,"
868,63,stands representative in gold
869,63,"of rose and lily, manifold,"
870,63,and countless butterfly!
871,64,a secret told—
872,64,ceases to be a secret—then—
873,64,a secret—kept—
874,64,that—can appal but one—
875,64,better of it—continual be afraid—
876,64,than it—
877,64,and whom you told it to—beside—
878,65,"a sepal, petal, and a thorn"
879,65,upon a common summer's morn—
880,65,a flask of dew—a bee or two—
881,65,a breeze—a caper in the trees—
882,65,and i'm a rose!
883,66,a shade upon the mind there passes
884,66,as when on noon
885,66,a cloud the mighty sun encloses
886,66,remembering
887,66,that some there be too numb to notice
888,66,oh god
889,66,why give if thou must take away
890,66,the loved?
891,67,a shady friend for torrid days
892,67,is easier to find
893,67,than one of higher temperature
894,67,for frigid hour of mind.
895,67,the vane a little to the east
896,67,scares muslin souls away;
897,67,if broadcloth breasts are firmer
898,67,"than those of organdy,"
899,67,who is to blame? the weaver?
900,67,ah! the bewildering thread!
901,67,the tapestries of paradise!
902,67,so notelessly are made!
903,68,is all that pins the soul
904,68,"that stands for deity, to mine,"
905,68,upon my side the veil—
906,68,once witnessed of the gauze—
907,68,its name is put away
908,68,"as far from mine, as if no plight"
909,68,"had printed yesterday,"
910,68,"in tender—solemn alphabet,"
911,68,"my eyes just turned to see,"
912,68,when it was smuggled by my sight
913,68,into eternity—
914,68,more hands—to hold—these are but two—
915,68,one more new-mailed nerve
916,68,"just granted, for the peril's sake—"
917,68,some striding—giant—love—
918,68,"so greater than the gods can show,"
919,68,"they slink before the clay,"
920,68,that not for all their heaven can boast
921,68,will let its keepsake—go
922,69,a slash of blue—
923,69,a sweep of gray—
924,69,"some scarlet patches on the way,"
925,69,compose an evening sky—
926,69,a little purple—slipped between—
927,69,some ruby trousers hurried on—
928,69,a wave of gold—
929,69,a bank of day—
930,69,this just makes out the morning sky.
931,70,a solemn thing within the soul
932,70,to feel itself get ripe—
933,70,and golden hang—while farther up—
934,70,the maker's ladders stop—
935,70,and in the orchard far below—
936,70,you hear a being—drop—
937,70,a wonderful—to feel the sun
938,70,still toiling at the cheek
939,70,you thought was finished—
940,70,"cool of eye, and critical of work—"
941,70,he shifts the stem—a little—
942,70,to give your core—a look—
943,70,but solemnest—to know
944,70,your chance in harvest moves
945,70,a little nearer—every sun
946,70,the single—to some lives.
947,71,a solemn thing—it was—i said—
948,71,a woman—white—to be—
949,71,and wear—if god should count me fit—
950,71,her blameless mystery—
951,71,a hallowed thing—to drop a life
952,71,into the purple well—
953,71,too plummetless—that it return—
954,71,eternity—until—
955,71,i pondered how the bliss would look—
956,71,and would it feel as big—
957,71,when i could take it in my hand—
958,71,as hovering—seen—through fog—
959,71,"and then—the size of this ""small"" life—"
960,71,the sages—call it small—
961,71,swelled—like horizons—in my vest—
962,71,"and i sneered—softly—""small""!"
963,72,a something in a summer's day
964,72,as slow her flambeaux burn away
965,72,which solemnizes me.
966,72,a something in a summer's noon—
967,72,a depth—an azure—a perfume—
968,72,transcending ecstasy.
969,72,and still within a summer's night
970,72,a something so transporting bright
971,72,i clap my hands to see—
972,72,then veil my too inspecting face
973,72,lets such a subtle—shimmering grace
974,72,flutter too far for me—
975,72,the wizard fingers never rest—
976,72,the purple brook within the breast
977,72,still chafes it narrow bed—
978,72,still rears the east her amber flag—
979,72,guides still the sun along the crag
980,72,his caravan of red—
981,72,so looking on—the night—the morn
982,72,conclude the wonder gay—
983,72,"and i meet, coming thro' the dews"
984,72,another summer's day!
985,73,a south wind—has a pathos
986,73,of individual voice—
987,73,as one detect on landings
988,73,an emigrant's address.
989,73,a hint of ports and peoples—
990,73,and much not understood—
991,73,the fairer—for the farness—
992,73,and for the foreignhood.
993,74,a still—volcano—life—
994,74,that flickered in the night—
995,74,when it was dark enough to do
996,74,without erasing sight—
997,74,a quiet—earthquake style—
998,74,too subtle to suspect
999,74,by natures this side naples—
1000,74,the north cannot detect
1001,74,the solemn—torrid—symbol—
1002,74,the lips that never lie—
1003,74,whose hissing corals part—and shut—
1004,74,and cities—ooze away—
1005,75,a thought went up my mind to-day
1006,75,"that i have had before,"
1007,75,"but did not finish, some way back,"
1008,75,"i could not fix the year,"
1009,75,"nor where it went, nor why it came"
1010,75,"the second time to me,"
1011,75,"nor definitely what it was,"
1012,75,have i the art to say.
1013,75,"but somewhere in my soul, i know"
1014,75,i've met the thing before;
1015,75,it just reminded me 't was all 
1016,75,and came my way no more.
1017,76,a throe upon the features—
1018,76,a hurry in the breath—
1019,76,an ecstasy of parting
1020,76,"denominated ""death""—"
1021,76,an anguish at the mention
1022,76,"which when to patience grown,"
1023,76,i've known permission given
1024,76,to rejoin its own.
1025,77,a toad can die of light!
1026,77,   death is the common right
1027,77,"     of toads and men, "
1028,77,   of earl and midge
1029,77,   the privilege.
1030,77,     why swagger then?
1031,77,   the gnat's supremacy
1032,77,   is large as thine.
1033,78,a tongue—to tell him i am true!
1034,78,its fee—to be of gold—
1035,78,had nature—in her monstrous house
1036,78,a single ragged child—
1037,78,to earn a mine—would run
1038,78,"that interdicted way,"
1039,78,and tell him—charge thee speak it plain—
1040,78,that so far—truth is true?
1041,78,and answer what i do—
1042,78,beginning with the day
1043,78,that night—begun—
1044,78,nay—midnight—'twas—
1045,78,since midnight—happened—say—
1046,78,if once more—pardon—boy—
1047,78,the magnitude thou may
1048,78,enlarge my message—if too vast
1049,78,another lad—help thee—
1050,78,thy pay—in diamonds—be—
1051,78,and his—in solid gold—
1052,78,say rubies—if he hesitate—
1053,78,my message—must be told—
1054,78,say—last i said—was this—
1055,78,that when the hills—come down—
1056,78,and hold no higher than the plain—
1057,78,my bond—have just begun—
1058,78,and when the heavens—disband—
1059,78,and deity conclude—
1060,78,then—look for me. be sure you say—
1061,78,least figure—on the road—
1062,79,a tooth upon our peace
1063,79,the peace cannot deface—
1064,79,then wherefore be the tooth?
1065,79,to vitalize the grace—
1066,79,the heaven hath a hell—
1067,79,itself to signalize—
1068,79,and every sign before the place
1069,79,is gilt with sacrifice—
1070,80,a transport one cannot contain
1071,80,may yet a transport be—
1072,80,though god forbid it lift the lid—
1073,80,unto its ecstasy!
1074,80,a diagram—of rapture!
1075,80,a sixpence at a show—
1076,80,with holy ghosts in cages!
1077,80,the universe would go!
1078,81,a visitor in marl—
1079,81,who influences flowers—
1080,81,till they are orderly as busts—
1081,81,and elegant—as glass—
1082,81,who visits in the night—
1083,81,and just before the sun—
1084,81,concludes his glistening interview—
1085,81,caresses—and is gone—
1086,81,but whom his fingers touched—
1087,81,and where his feet have run—
1088,81,and whatsoever mouth be kissed—
1089,81,is as it had not been—
1090,82,a weight with needles on the pounds—
1091,82,"to push, and pierce, besides—"
1092,82,that if the flesh resist the heft—
1093,82,the puncture—coolly tries—
1094,82,that not a pore be overlooked
1095,82,of all this compound frame—
1096,82,as manifold for anguish—
1097,82,as species—be—for name—
1098,83,a wife—at daybreak i shall be—
1099,83,sunrise—hast thou a flag for me?
1100,83,"at midnight, i am but a maid,"
1101,83,how short it takes to make a bride—
1102,83,"then—midnight, i have passed from thee"
1103,83,"unto the east, and victory—"
1104,83,"midnight—good night! i hear them call,"
1105,83,the angels bustle in the hall—
1106,83,"softly my future climbs the stair,"
1107,83,i fumble at my childhood's prayer
1108,83,so soon to be a child no more—
1109,83,"eternity, i'm coming—sire,"
1110,83,savior—i've seen the face—before!
1111,84,a wounded deer—leaps highest—
1112,84,i've heard the hunter tell—
1113,84,'tis but the ecstasy of death—
1114,84,and then the brake is still!
1115,84,the smitten rock that gushes!
1116,84,the trampled steel that springs!
1117,84,a cheek is always redder
1118,84,just where the hectic stings!
1119,84,mirth is the mail of anguish
1120,84,"in which it cautious arm,"
1121,84,lest anybody spy the blood
1122,84,"and ""you're hurt"" exclaim!"
1123,85,abraham to kill him
1124,85,was distinctly told—
1125,85,isaac was an urchin—
1126,85,abraham was old—
1127,85,not a hesitation—
1128,85,abraham complied—
1129,85,flattered by obeisance
1130,85,tyranny demurred—
1131,85,isaac—to his children
1132,85,lived to tell the tale—
1133,85,moral—with a mastiff
1134,85,manners may prevail.
1135,86,absence disembodies—so does death
1136,86,hiding individuals from the earth
1137,86,"superposition helps, as well as love—"
1138,86,tenderness decreases as we prove—
1139,87,absent place—an april day—
1140,87,daffodils a-blow
1141,87,homesick curiosity
1142,87,to the souls that snow—
1143,87,drift may block within it
1144,87,deeper than without—
1145,87,daffodil delight but
1146,87,him it duplicate—
1147,88,adrift! a little boat adrift!
1148,88,and night is coming down!
1149,88,will no one guide a little boat
1150,88,unto the nearest town?
1151,88,so sailors say—on yesterday—
1152,88,just as the dusk was brown
1153,88,one little boat gave up its strife
1154,88,and gurgled down and down.
1155,88,so angels say—on yesterday—
1156,88,just as the dawn was red
1157,88,one little boat—o'erspent with gales—
1158,88,retrimmed its masts—redecked its sails—
1159,88,and shot—exultant on!
1160,89,afraid! of whom am i afraid?
1161,89,not death—for who is he?
1162,89,the porter of my father's lodge
1163,89,as much abasheth me!
1164,89,of life? 'twere odd i fear [a] thing
1165,89,that comprehendeth me
1166,89,in one or two existences—
1167,89,as deity decree—
1168,89,of resurrection? is the east
1169,89,afraid to trust the morn
1170,89,with her fastidious forehead?
1171,89,as soon impeach my crown!
1172,90,after a hundred years
1173,90,"nobody knows the place, "
1174,90,"agony, that enacted there,"
1175,90,motionless as peace.
1176,90,"weeds triumphant ranged,"
1177,90,strangers strolled and spelled
1178,90,at the lone orthography
1179,90,of the elder dead.
1180,90,winds of summer fields
1181,90,"recollect the way, "
1182,90,instinct picking up the key
1183,90,dropped by memory.
1184,91,"after great pain, a formal feeling comes "
1185,91,"the nerves sit ceremonious, like tombs "
1186,91,"the stiff heart questions was it he, that bore,"
1187,91,"and yesterday, or centuries before?"
1188,91,"the feet, mechanical, go round "
1189,91,"of ground, or air, or ought "
1190,91,a wooden way
1191,91,"regardless grown,"
1192,91,"a quartz contentment, like a stone "
1193,91,this is the hour of lead 
1194,91,"remembered, if outlived,"
1195,91,as freezing persons recollect the snow 
1196,91,first chill then stupor then the letting go 
1197,92,again—his voice is at the door—
1198,92,i feel the old degree—
1199,92,i hear him ask the servant
1200,92,for such an one—as me—
1201,92,i take a flower—as i go—
1202,92,my face to justify—
1203,92,he never saw me—in this life—
1204,92,i might surprise his eye!
1205,92,i cross the hall with mingled steps—
1206,92,i—silent—pass the door—
1207,92,i look on all this world contains—
1208,92,just his face—nothing more!
1209,92,we talk in careless—and it toss—
1210,92,a kind of plummet strain—
1211,92,each—sounding—shyly—
1212,92,just—how—deep—
1213,92,the other's one—had been—
1214,92,we walk—i leave my dog—at home—
1215,92,a tender—thoughtful moon—
1216,92,goes with us—just a little way—
1217,92,and—then—we are alone—
1218,92,"alone—if angels are ""alone""—"
1219,92,first time they try the sky!
1220,92,"alone—if those ""veiled faces""—be—"
1221,92,we cannot count—on high!
1222,92,i'd give—to live that hour—again—
1223,92,the purple—in my vein—
1224,92,but he must count the drops—himself—
1225,92,my price for every stain!
1226,93,"ah, moon—and star!"
1227,93,you are very far—
1228,93,but were no one
1229,93,farther than you—
1230,93,do you think i'd stop
1231,93,for a firmament—
1232,93,or a cubit—or so?
1233,93,i could borrow a bonnet
1234,93,of the lark—
1235,93,and a chamois' silver boot—
1236,93,and a stirrup of an antelope—
1237,93,and be with you—tonight!
1238,93,"but, moon, and star,"
1239,93,though you're very far—
1240,93,there is one—farther than you—
1241,93,he—is more than a firmament—from me—
1242,93,so i can never go!
1243,94,"ah, necromancy sweet!"
1244,94,"ah, wizard erudite!"
1245,94,"teach me the skill,"
1246,94,that i instill the pain
1247,94,"surgeons assuage in vain,"
1248,94,nor herb of all the plain
1249,94,can heal!
1250,95,"ah, teneriffe!"
1251,95,retreating mountain!
1252,95,purples of ages—pause for you—
1253,95,sunset—reviews her sapphire regiment—
1254,95,day—drops you her red adieu!
1255,95,still—clad in your mail of ices—
1256,95,thigh of granite—and thew—of steel—
1257,95,heedless—alike—of pomp—or parting
1258,95,"ah, teneriffe!"
1259,95,i'm kneeling—still—
1260,96,"all but death, can be adjusted—"
1261,96,dynasties repaired—
1262,96,systems—settled in their sockets—
1263,96,citadels—dissolved—
1264,96,wastes of lives—resown with colors
1265,96,by succeeding springs—
1266,96,death—unto itself—exception—
1267,96,is exempt from change—
1268,97,all circumstances are the frame
1269,97,in which his face is set—
1270,97,all latitudes exist for his
1271,97,sufficient continent—
1272,97,"the light his action, and the dark"
1273,97,the leisure of his will—
1274,97,in him existence serve or set
1275,97,a force illegible.
1276,98,all forgot for recollecting
1277,98,just a paltry one—
1278,98,"all forsook, for just a stranger's"
1279,98,new accompanying—
1280,98,"grace of wealth, and grace of station"
1281,98,less accounted than
1282,98,an unknown esteem possessing—
1283,98,estimate—who can—
1284,98,home effaced—her faces dwindled—
1285,98,nature—altered small—
1286,98,sun—if shone—or storm—if shattered—
1287,98,overlooked i all—
1288,98,dropped—my fate—a timid pebble—
1289,98,in thy bolder sea—
1290,98,prove—me—sweet—if i regret it—
1291,98,prove myself—of thee—
1292,99,"all i may, if small,"
1293,99,do it not display
1294,99,larger for the totalness—
1295,99,'tis economy
1296,99,to bestow a world
1297,99,and withhold a star—
1298,99,"utmost, is munificence—"
1299,99,"less, tho' larger, poor."
1300,100,"all overgrown by cunning moss,"
1301,100,"all interspersed with weed,"
1302,100,"the little cage of ""currer bell"""
1303,100,"in quiet ""haworth"" laid."
1304,100,gathered from many wanderings—
1305,100,gethsemane can tell
1306,100,thro' what transporting anguish
1307,100,she reached the asphodel!
1308,100,soft falls the sounds of eden
1309,100,upon her puzzled ear—
1310,100,"oh what an afternoon for heaven,"
1311,100,"when ""bronte"" entered there!"
1312,101,all the letters i can write
1313,101,are not fair as this—
1314,101,syllables of velvet—
1315,101,"sentences of plush,"
1316,101,"depths of ruby, undrained,"
1317,101,"hid, lip, for thee—"
1318,101,play it were a humming bird—
1319,101,and just sipped—me—
1320,102,all these my banners be.
1321,102,i sow my pageantry
1322,102,in may—
1323,102,it rises train by train—
1324,102,then sleeps in state again—
1325,102,my chancel—all the plain
1326,102,    today.
1327,102,to lose—if one can find again—
1328,102,to miss—if one shall meet—
1329,102,the burglar cannot rob—then—
1330,102,the broker cannot cheat.
1331,102,so build the hillocks gaily
1332,102,thou little spade of mine
1333,102,leaving nooks for daisy
1334,102,and for columbine—
1335,102,you and i the secret
1336,102,of the crocus know—
1337,102,let us chant it softly—
1338,102,"""there is no more snow!"""
1339,102,to him who keeps an orchis' heart—
1340,102,the swamps are pink with june.
1341,103,"alone, i cannot be—"
1342,103,for hosts—do visit me—
1343,103,recordless company—
1344,103,who baffle key—
1345,103,"they have no robes, nor names—"
1346,103,no almanacs—nor climes—
1347,103,but general homes
1348,103,like gnomes—
1349,103,"their coming, may be known"
1350,103,by couriers within—
1351,103,their going—is not—
1352,103,for they've never gone—
1353,104,alter! when the hills do—
1354,104,falter! when the sun
1355,104,question if his glory
1356,104,be the perfect one—
1357,104,surfeit! when the daffodil
1358,104,doth of the dew—
1359,104,even as herself—sir—
1360,104,i will—of you—
1361,105,although i put away his life—
1362,105,an ornament too grand
1363,105,"for forehead low as mine, to wear,"
1364,105,this might have been the hand
1365,105,"that sowed the flower, he preferred—"
1366,105,"or smoothed a homely pain,"
1367,105,or pushed the pebble from his path—
1368,105,or played his chosen tune—
1369,105,on lute the least—the latest—
1370,105,but just his ear could know
1371,105,"that whatsoe'er delighted it,"
1372,105,i never would let go—
1373,105,the foot to bear his errand—
1374,105,a little boot i know—
1375,105,would leap abroad like antelope—
1376,105,with just the grant to do—
1377,105,his weariest commandment—
1378,105,"a sweeter to obey,"
1379,105,"than ""hide and seek""—"
1380,105,or skip to flutes—
1381,105,"or all day, chase the bee—"
1382,105,"your servant, sir, will weary—"
1383,105,"the surgeon, will not come—"
1384,105,"the world, will have its own—to do—"
1385,105,"the dust, will vex your fame—"
1386,105,the cold will force your tightest door
1387,105,"some february day,"
1388,105,but say my apron bring the sticks
1389,105,to make your cottage gay—
1390,105,that i may take that promise
1391,105,"to paradise, with me—"
1392,105,"to teach the angels, avarice,"
1393,105,"you, sir, taught first—to me."
1394,106,always mine!
1395,106,no more vacation!
1396,106,term of light this day begun!
1397,106,failless as the fair rotation
1398,106,of the seasons and the sun.
1399,106,"old the grace, but new the subjects—"
1400,106,"old, indeed, the east,"
1401,106,yet upon his purple programme
1402,106,"every dawn, is first."
1403,107,ambition cannot find him.
1404,107,affection doesn't know
1405,107,how many leagues of nowhere
1406,107,lie between them now.
1407,107,"yesterday, undistinguished!"
1408,107,eminent today
1409,107,"for our mutual hone, immortality!"
1410,108,ample make this bed—
1411,108,make this bed with awe—
1412,108,in it wait till judgment break
1413,108,excellent and fair.
1414,108,be its mattress straight—
1415,108,be its pillow round—
1416,108,let no sunrise' yellow noise
1417,108,interrupt this ground—
1418,109,an altered look about the hills—
1419,109,a tyrian light the village fills—
1420,109,a wider sunrise in the morn—
1421,109,a deeper twilight on the lawn—
1422,109,a print of a vermilion foot—
1423,109,a purple finger on the slope—
1424,109,a flippant fly upon the pane—
1425,109,a spider at his trade again—
1426,109,an added strut in chanticleer—
1427,109,a flower expected everywhere—
1428,109,an axe shrill singing in the woods—
1429,109,fern odors on untraveled roads—
1430,109,all this and more i cannot tell—
1431,109,a furtive look you know as well—
1432,109,and nicodemus' mystery
1433,109,receives its annual reply!
1434,110,an awful tempest mashed the air—
1435,110,"the clouds were gaunt, and few—"
1436,110,a black—as of a spectre's cloak
1437,110,hid heaven and earth from view.
1438,110,the creatures chuckled on the roofs—
1439,110,and whistled in the air—
1440,110,and shook their fists—
1441,110,and gnashed their teeth—
1442,110,and swung their frenzied hair.
1443,110,the morning lit—the birds arose—
1444,110,the monster's faded eyes
1445,110,turned slowly to his native coast—
1446,110,and peace—was paradise!
1447,111,"an everywhere of silver,"
1448,111,with ropes of sand
1449,111,to keep it from effacing
1450,111,the track called land.
1451,112,an hour is a sea
1452,112,"between a few, and me—"
1453,112,with them would harbor be—
1454,113,an ignorance a sunset
1455,113,confer upon the eye—
1456,113,of territory—color—
1457,113,circumference—decay—
1458,113,its amber revelation
1459,113,exhilarate—debase—
1460,113,omnipotence' inspection
1461,113,of our inferior face—
1462,113,and when the solemn features
1463,113,confirm—in victory—
1464,113,we start—as if detected
1465,113,in immortality—
1466,114,and this of all my hopes
1467,114,"this, is the silent end"
1468,114,"bountiful colored, my morning rose"
1469,114,"early and sere, its end"
1470,114,never bud from a stem
1471,114,stepped with so gay a foot
1472,114,never a worm so confident
1473,114,bored at so brave a root
1474,115,"angels, in the early morning"
1475,115,"may be seen the dews among,"
1476,115,stooping—plucking—smiling—flying—
1477,115,do the buds to them belong?
1478,115,"angels, when the sun is hottest"
1479,115,"may be seen the sands among,"
1480,115,stooping—plucking—sighing—flying—
1481,115,parched the flowers they bear along.
1482,116,answer july—
1483,116,where is the bee—
1484,116,where is the blush—
1485,116,where is the hay?
1486,116,"ah, said july—"
1487,116,where is the seed—
1488,116,where is the bud—
1489,116,where is the may—
1490,116,answer thee—me—
1491,116,nay—said the may—
1492,116,show me the snow—
1493,116,show me the bells—
1494,116,show me the jay!
1495,116,quibbled the jay—
1496,116,where be the maize—
1497,116,where be the haze—
1498,116,where be the bur?
1499,116,here—said the year—
1500,117,apology for her
1501,117,be rendered by the bee—
1502,117,"herself, without a parliament"
1503,117,apology for me.
1504,118,"apparently with no surprise,"
1505,118,"       to any happy flower,"
1506,118,"       the frost beheads it at its play,"
1507,118,       in accidental power.
1508,118,       the blond assassin passes on.
1509,118,"       the sun proceeds unmoved,"
1510,118,"       to measure off another day,"
1511,118,       for an approving god.
1512,119,"""arcturus"" is his other name—"
1513,119,"i'd rather call him ""star."""
1514,119,it's very mean of science

1523,119,"and has her in a ""class""!"
1524,119,whereas i took the butterfly

1540,119,i hope the father in the skies

1548,120,for the easel here
1549,120,say repose!
1550,121,"as by the dead we love to sit,"

1552,121,as for the lost we grapple
1553,121,tho' all the rest are here—
1554,121,in broken mathematics
1555,121,we estimate our prize
1556,121,vast—in its fading ration
1557,121,to our penurious eyes!
1558,122,"as children bid the guest ""good night"""
1559,122,and then reluctant turn—
1560,122,my flowers raise their pretty lips—
1561,122,then put their nightgowns on.
1562,122,as children caper when they wake
1563,122,merry that it is morn—
1564,122,my flowers from a hundred cribs
1565,122,"will peep, and prance again."
1566,123,as everywhere of silver
1567,123,with ropes of sand
1568,123,to keep it from effacing
1569,123,the track called land.
1570,124,"as far from pity, as complaint—"
1571,124,as cool to speech—as stone—
1572,124,as numb to revelation
1573,124,as if my trade were bone—
1574,124,as far from time—as history—
1575,124,as near yourself—today—
1576,124,"as children, to the rainbow's scarf—"
1577,124,or sunset's yellow play
1578,124,to eyelids in the sepulchre—
1579,124,how dumb the dancer lies—
1580,124,while color's revelations break—
1581,124,and blaze—the butterflies!
1582,125,as frost is best conceived
1583,125,by force of its result—
1584,125,affliction is inferred
1585,125,by subsequent effect—
1586,125,"if when the sun reveal,"

1588,125,if as the days resume
1589,125,the wilted countenance

1591,125,or counteract the stain—
1592,125,presumption is vitality

1594,126,as if some little arctic flower
1595,126,upon the polar hem—
1596,126,went wandering down the latitudes
1597,126,until it puzzled came
1598,126,to continents of summer—
1599,126,to firmaments of sun—
1600,126,"to strange, bright crowds of flowers—"
1601,126,"and birds, of foreign tongue!"
1602,126,"i say, as if this little flower"

1604,126,"what then? why nothing,"
1605,126,"only, your inference therefrom!"
1606,127,as if the sea should part
1607,127,and show a further sea—

1610,127,of periods of seas—
1611,127,unvisited of shores—
1612,127,themselves the verge of seas to be—
1613,127,eternity—is those—
1614,128,as imperceptibly as grief
1615,128,"  the summer lapsed away, "
1616,128,"  too imperceptible, at last,"
1617,128,  to seem like perfidy.
1618,128,"  a quietness distilled,"
1619,128,"  as twilight long begun,"
1620,128,"  or nature, spending with herself"
1621,128,  sequestered afternoon.
1622,128,"  the dusk drew earlier in,"
1623,128,"  the morning foreign shone, "
1624,128,"  a courteous, yet harrowing grace,"
1625,128, as guest who would be gone.
1626,128,"  and thus, without a wing,"
1627,128," or service of a keel,"
1628,128,  our summer made her light escape
1629,128, into the beautiful.
1630,129,as one does sickness over
1631,129,"in convalescent mind,"
1632,129,his scrutiny of chances
1633,129,by blessed health obscured—
1634,129,as one rewalks a precipice
1635,129,and whittles at the twig
1636,129,that held him from perdition
1637,129,sown sidewise in the crag
1638,129,a custom of the soul
1639,129,far after suffering
1640,129,identity to question
1641,129,for evidence't has been—
1642,130,as plan for noon and plan for night
1643,130,so differ life and death
1644,130,in positive prospective—
1645,130,the foot upon the earth
1646,130,"at distance, and achievement, strains,"
1647,130,the foot upon the grave
1648,130,makes effort at conclusion
1649,130,assisted faint of love.
1650,131,as sleigh bells seem in summer
1651,131,"or bees, at christmas show—"
1652,131,so fairy—so fictitious
1653,131,the individuals do
1654,131,repealed from observation—
1655,131,a party that we knew—
1656,131,more distant in an instant
1657,131,than dawn in timbuctoo.
1658,132,as the starved maelstrom laps the navies
1659,132,as the vulture teased
1660,132,forces the broods in lonely valleys
1661,132,as the tiger eased
1662,132,"by but a crumb of blood, fasts scarlet"
1663,132,till he meet a man
1664,132,dainty adorned with veins and tissues
1665,132,and partakes—his tongue
1666,132,cooled by the morsel for a moment
1667,132,grows a fiercer thing
1668,132,till he esteem his dates and cocoa
1669,132,a nutrition mean
1670,132,"i, of a finer famine"
1671,132,deem my supper dry
1672,132,for but a berry of domingo
1673,132,and a torrid eye.
1674,133,"as watchers hang upon the east,"
1675,133,as beggars revel at a feast
1676,133,by savory fancy spread—
1677,133,as brooks in deserts babble sweet
1678,133,"on ear too far for the delight,"
1679,133,heaven beguiles the tired.
1680,133,"as that same watcher, when the east"
1681,133,opens the lid of amethyst
1682,133,and lets the morning go—
1683,133,"that beggar, when an honored guest,"
1684,133,"those thirsty lips to flagons pressed,"
1685,133,"heaven to us, if true."
1686,134,"at last, to be identified!"
1687,134,"at last, the lamps upon thy side"
1688,134,the rest of life to see!
1689,134,past midnight! past the morning star!
1690,134,past sunrise!
1691,134,"ah, what leagues there were"
1692,134,"between our feet, and day!"
1693,135,at least—to pray—is left—is left—
1694,135,oh jesus—in the air—
1695,135,i know not which thy chamber is—
1696,135,i'm knocking—everywhere—
1697,135,thou settest earthquake in the south—
1698,135,"and maelstrom, in the sea—"
1699,135,"say, jesus christ of nazareth—"
1700,135,hast thou no arm for me?
1701,136,at leisure is the soul
1702,136,that gets a staggering blow—
1703,136,the width of life—before it spreads
1704,136,without a thing to do—
1705,136,it begs you give it work—
1706,136,but just the placing pins—
1707,136,or humblest patchwork—children do—
1708,136,to help its vacant hands—
1709,137,autumn—overlooked my knitting—
1710,137,dyes—said he—have i—
1711,137,could disparage a flamingo—
1712,137,show me them—said i—
1713,137,cochineal—i chose—for deeming
1714,137,it resemble thee—
1715,137,and the little border—dusker—
1716,137,for resembling me—
1717,138,"awake ye muses nine, sing me a strain divine,"
1718,138,"unwind the solemn twine, and tie my valentine!"
1719,138,"oh the earth was made for lovers, for damsel, and hopeless swain,"
1720,138,"for sighing, and gentle whispering, and unity made of twain."
1721,138,"all things do go a courting, in earth, or sea, or air,"
1722,138,god hath made nothing single but thee in his world so fair!
1723,138,"the bride, and then the bridegroom, the two, and then the one,"
1724,138,"adam, and eve, his consort, the moon, and then the sun;"
1725,138,"the life doth prove the precept, who obey shall happy be,"
1726,138,"who will not serve the sovereign, be hanged on fatal tree."
1727,138,"the high do seek the lowly, the great do seek the small,"
1728,138,"none cannot find who seeketh, on this terrestrial ball;"
1729,138,"the bee doth court the flower, the flower his suit receives,"
1730,138,"and they make merry wedding, whose guests are hundred leaves;"
1731,138,"the wind doth woo the branches, the branches they are won,"
1732,138,and the father fond demandeth the maiden for his son.
1733,138,"the storm doth walk the seashore humming a mournful tune,"
1734,138,"the wave with eye so pensive, looketh to see the moon,"
1735,138,"their spirits meet together, they make their solemn vows,"
1736,138,"no more he singeth mournful, her sadness she doth lose."
1737,138,"the worm doth woo the mortal, death claims a living bride,"
1738,138,"night unto day is married, morn unto eventide;"
1739,138,"earth is a merry damsel, and heaven a knight so true,"
1740,138,"and earth is quite coquettish, and beseemeth in vain to sue."
1741,138,"now to the application, to the reading of the roll,"
1742,138,"to bringing thee to justice, and marshalling thy soul,"
1743,138,"thou art a human solo, a being cold, and lone,"
1744,138,"wilt have no kind companion, thou reap'st what thou hast sown."
1745,138,"hast never silent hours, and minutes all too long,"
1746,138,"and a deal of sad reflection, and wailing instead of song?"
1747,138,"there's sarah, and eliza, and emeline so fair,"
1748,138,"and harriet, and susan, and she with curling hair!"
1749,138,"thine eyes are sadly blinded, but yet thou mayest see"
1750,138,"six true, and comely maidens sitting upon the tree;"
1751,138,"approach that tree with caution, then up it boldly climb,"
1752,138,"and seize the one thou lovest, nor care for space, or time!"
1753,138,"then bear her to the greenwood, and build for her a bower,"
1754,138,"and give her what she asketh, jewel, or bird, or flower—"
1755,138,"and bring the fife, and trumpet, and beat upon the drum—"
1756,138,"and bid the world goodmorrow, and go to glory home!"
1757,139,away from home are some and i—
1758,139,an emigrant to be
1759,139,in a metropolis of homes
1760,139,"is easy, possibly—"
1761,139,the habit of a foreign sky
1762,139,we—difficult—acquire
1763,139,"as children, who remain in face"
1764,139,the more their feet retire.
1765,140,baffled for just a day or two—
1766,140,embarrassed—not afraid—
1767,140,encounter in my garden
1768,140,an unexpected maid.
1769,140,"she beckons, and the woods start—"
1770,140,"she nods, and all begin—"
1771,140,"surely, such a country"
1772,140,i was never in!
1773,141,banish air from air—
1774,141,divide light if you dare—
1775,141,they'll meet
1776,141,while cubes in a drop
1777,141,or pellets of shape
1778,141,fit
1779,141,films cannot annul
1780,141,odors return whole
1781,141,force flame
1782,141,and with a blonde push
1783,141,over your impotence
1784,141,flits steam.
1785,142,be mine the doom—
1786,142,sufficient fame—
1787,142,to perish in her hand!
1788,143,beauty—be not caused—it is—
1789,143,"chase it, and it ceases—"
1790,143,"chase it not, and it abides—"
1791,143,overtake the creases
1792,143,in the meadow—when the wind
1793,143,runs his fingers thro' it—
1794,143,deity will see to it
1795,143,that you never do it—
1796,144,"because i could not stop for death,"
1797,144,he kindly stopped for me;
1798,144,the carriage held but just ourselves
1799,144,and immortality.
1800,144,"we slowly drove, he knew no haste,"
1801,144,and i had put away
1802,144,"my labor, and my leisure too,"
1803,144,for his civility.
1804,144,"we passed the school where children played,"
1805,144,their lessons scarcely done;
1806,144,"we passed the fields of gazing grain,"
1807,144,we passed the setting sun.
1808,144,we paused before a house that seemed
1809,144,a swelling of the ground;
1810,144,"the roof was scarcely visible,"
1811,144,the cornice but a mound.
1812,144,since then 't is centuries; but each
1813,144,feels shorter than the day
1814,144,i first surmised the horses' heads
1815,144,were toward eternity.
1816,145,because the bee may blameless hum
1817,145,for thee a bee do i become
1818,145,list even unto me.
1819,145,because the flowers unafraid
1820,145,"may lift a look on thine, a maid"
1821,145,alway a flower would be.
1822,145,"nor robins, robins need not hide"
1823,145,when thou upon their crypts intrude
1824,145,so wings bestow on me
1825,145,"or petals, or a dower of buzz"
1826,145,"that bee to ride, or flower of furze"
1827,145,i that way worship thee.
1828,146,"the sky is low, the clouds are mean,  "
1829,146,a travelling flake of snow  
1830,146,across a barn or through a rut  
1831,146,debates if it will go.  
1832,146,a narrow wind complains all day
1833,146,how some one treated him;  
1834,146,"nature, like us, is sometimes caught  "
1835,146,without her diadem.
1836,147,bee! i'm expecting you!
1837,147,was saying yesterday
1838,147,to somebody you know
1839,147,that you were due—
1840,147,the frogs got home last week—
1841,147,"are settled, and at work—"
1842,147,"birds, mostly back—"
1843,147,the clover warm and thick—
1844,147,you'll get my letter by
1845,147,the seventeenth; reply
1846,147,"or better, be with me—"
1847,147,"yours, fly."
1848,148,before he comes we weigh the time!
1849,148,'tis heavy and 'tis light.
1850,148,"when he depart, an emptiness"
1851,148,is the prevailing freight.
1852,149,before i got my eye put out
1853,149,i liked as well to see—
1854,149,"as other creatures, that have eyes"
1855,149,and know no other way—
1856,149,but were it told to me—today—
1857,149,that i might have the sky
1858,149,for mine—i tell you that my heart
1859,149,"would split, for size of me—"
1860,149,the meadows—mine—
1861,149,the mountains—mine—
1862,149,all forests—stintless stars—
1863,149,as much of noon as i could take
1864,149,between my finite eyes—
1865,149,the motions of the dipping birds—
1866,149,the morning's amber road—
1867,149,for mine—to look at when i liked—
1868,149,the news would strike me dead—
1869,149,so safer—guess—with just my soul
1870,149,upon the window pane—
1871,149,where other creatures put their eyes—
1872,149,incautious—of the sun—
1873,150,before the ice is in the pools—
1874,150,"before the skaters go,"
1875,150,or any check at nightfall
1876,150,is tarnished by the snow—
1877,150,"before the fields have finished,"
1878,150,"before the christmas tree,"
1879,150,wonder upon wonder
1880,150,will arrive to me!
1881,150,what we touch the hems of
1882,150,on a summer's day—
1883,150,what is only walking
1884,150,just a bridge away—
1885,150,that which sings so—speaks so—
1886,150,when there's no one here—
1887,150,will the frock i wept in
1888,150,answer me to wear?
1889,151,"before you thought of spring,"
1890,151,"except as a surmise,"
1891,151,"you see, god bless his suddenness,"
1892,151,a fellow in the skies
1893,151,"of independent hues,"
1894,151,"a little weather-worn,"
1895,151,inspiriting habiliments
1896,151,of indigo and brown.
1897,151,"with specimens of song,"
1898,151,"as if for you to choose,"
1899,151,"discretion in the interval,"
1900,151,with gay delays he goes
1901,151,to some superior tree
1902,151,"without a single leaf,"
1903,151,and shouts for joy to nobody
1904,151,but his seraphic self!
1905,152,behind me—dips eternity—
1906,152,before me—immortality—
1907,152,myself—the term between—
1908,152,"death but the drift of eastern gray,"
1909,152,"dissolving into dawn away,"
1910,152,before the west begin—
1911,152,'tis kingdoms—afterward—they say—
1912,152,in perfect—pauseless monarchy—
1913,152,whose prince—is son of none—
1914,152,himself—his dateless dynasty—
1915,152,himself—himself diversify—
1916,152,in duplicate divine—
1917,152,'tis miracle before me—then—
1918,152,'tis miracle behind—between—
1919,152,a crescent in the sea—
1920,152,with midnight to the north of her—
1921,152,and midnight to the south of her—
1922,152,and maelstrom—in the sky—
1923,153,"bereaved of all, i went abroad—"
1924,153,no less bereaved was i
1925,153,upon a new peninsula—
1926,153,the grave preceded me—
1927,153,"obtained my lodgings, ere myself—"
1928,153,and when i sought my bed—
1929,153,the grave it was reposed upon
1930,153,the pillow for my head—
1931,153,i waked to find it first awake—
1932,153,i rose—it followed me—
1933,153,i tried to drop it in the crowd—
1934,153,to lose it in the sea—
1935,153,in cups of artificial drowse
1936,153,to steep its shape away—
1937,153,the grave—was finished—but the spade
1938,153,remained in memory—
1939,154,bereavement in their death to feel
1940,154,whom we have never seen—
1941,154,a vital kinsmanship import
1942,154,our soul and theirs—between—
1943,154,for stranger—strangers do not mourn—
1944,154,there be immortal friends
1945,154,whom death see first—'tis news of this
1946,154,that paralyze ourselves—
1947,154,"who, vital only to our thought—"
1948,154,such presence bear away
1949,154,in dying—'tis as if our souls
1950,154,absconded—suddenly—
1951,155,besides the autumn poets sing
1952,155,a few prosaic days
1953,155,a little this side of the snow
1954,155,and that side of the haze—
1955,155,a few incisive mornings—
1956,155,a few ascetic eves—
1957,155,"gone—mr. bryant's ""golden rod""—"
1958,155,"and mr. thomson's ""sheaves."""
1959,155,"still, is the bustle in the brook—"
1960,155,sealed are the spicy valves—
1961,155,mesmeric fingers softly touch
1962,155,the eyes of many elves—
1963,155,perhaps a squirrel may remain—
1964,155,my sentiments to share—
1965,155,"grant me, oh lord, a sunny mind—"
1966,155,thy windy will to bear!
1967,156,besides this may
1968,156,we know
1969,156,there is another—
1970,156,how fair
1971,156,our speculations of the foreigner!
1972,156,some know him whom we knew—
1973,156,sweet wonder—
1974,156,a nature be
1975,156,"where saints, and our plain going neighbor"
1976,156,keep may!
1977,157,best gains—must have the losses' test—
1978,157,to constitute them—gains—
1979,158,best things dwell out of sight
1980,158,the pearl—the just—our thought.
1981,158,most shun the public air
1982,158,"legitimate, and rare—"
1983,158,the capsule of the wind
1984,158,the capsule of the mind
1985,158,"exhibit here, as doth a burr—"
1986,158,germ's germ be where?
1987,159,better—than music! for i—who heard it—
1988,159,i was used—to the birds—before—
1989,159,this—was different—'twas translation—
1990,159,of all tunes i knew—and more—
1991,159,'twasn't contained—like other stanza—
1992,159,no one could play it—the second time—
1993,159,but the composer—perfect mozart—
1994,159,perish with him—that keyless rhyme!
1995,159,so—children—told how brooks in eden—
1996,159,bubbled a better—melody—
1997,159,quaintly infer—eve's great surrender—
1998,159,urging the feet—that would—not—fly—
1999,159,children—matured—are wiser—mostly—
2000,159,eden—a legend—dimly told—
2001,159,eve—and the anguish—grandame's story—
2002,159,but—i was telling a tune—i heard—
2003,159,not such a strain—the church—baptizes—
2004,159,when the last saint—goes up the aisles—
2005,159,not such a stanza splits the silence—
2006,159,when the redemption strikes her bells—
2007,159,let me not spill—its smallest cadence—
2008,159,humming—for promise—when alone—
2009,159,humming—until my faint rehearsal—
2010,159,drop into tune—around the throne—
2011,160,between my country—and the others—
2012,160,there is a sea—
2013,160,but flowers—negotiate between us—
2014,160,as ministry.
2015,161,"a bird came down the walk,"
2016,161,he did not know i saw;
2017,161,he bit an angle-worm in halves
2018,161,"and ate the fellow, raw."
2019,161,and then he drank a dew
2020,161,"from a convenient grass,"
2021,161,and the hopped sideways to the wall
2022,161,to let a beetle pass.
2023,161,he glanced with rapid eyes
2024,161,"that hurried all abroad, -"
2025,161,"they looked like frightened beads, i thought"
2026,161,he stirred his velvet head.
2027,161,"like one in danger; cautious,"
2028,161,"i offered him a crumb,"
2029,161,and he unrolled his feathers
2030,161,and rolled him softer home
2031,161,"then oars divide the ocean,"
2032,161,"too silver for a seam,"
2033,161,"or butterflies, off banks of noon,"
2034,161,"leap, plashless, as they swim."
2035,162,blazing in gold and quenching in purple
2036,162,leaping like leopards to the sky
2037,162,then at the feet of the old horizon
2038,162,laying her spotted face to die
2039,162,stooping as low as the otter's window
2040,162,touching the roof and tinting the barn
2041,162,kissing her bonnet to the meadow
2042,162,and the juggler of day is gone
2043,163,"bless god, he went as soldiers,"
2044,163,his musket on his breast—
2045,163,"grant god, he charge the bravest"
2046,163,of all the martial blest!
2047,163,"please god, might i behold him"
2048,163,in epauletted white—
2049,163,i should not fear the foe then—
2050,163,i should not fear the fight!
2051,164,bloom upon the mountain—stated—
2052,164,blameless of a name—
2053,164,efflorescence of a sunset—
2054,164,reproduced—the same—
2055,164,"seed, had i, my purple sowing"
2056,164,should endow the day—
2057,164,not a topic of a twilight—
2058,164,show itself away—
2059,164,who for tilling—to the mountain
2060,164,"come, and disappear—"
2061,164,"whose be her renown, or fading,"
2062,164,"witness, is not here—"
2063,164,"while i state—the solemn petals,"
2064,164,"far as north—and east,"
2065,164,far as south and west—expanding—
2066,164,culminate—in rest—
2067,164,and the mountain to the evening
2068,164,fit his countenance—
2069,164,"indicating, by no muscle—"
2070,164,the experience—
2071,165,bound—a trouble—
2072,165,and lives can bear it!
2073,165,limit—how deep a bleeding go!
2074,165,so—many—drops—of vital scarlet—
2075,165,deal with the soul
2076,165,as with algebra!
2077,165,tell it the ages—to a cypher—
2078,165,and it will ache—contented—on—
2079,165,sing—at its pain—as any workman—
2080,165,notching the fall of the even sun!
2081,166,"bring me the sunset in a cup,"
2082,166,reckon the morning's flagons up
2083,166,"and say how many dew,"
2084,166,tell me how far the morning leaps—
2085,166,tell me what time the weaver sleeps
2086,166,who spun the breadth of blue!
2087,166,write me how many notes there be
2088,166,in the new robin's ecstasy
2089,166,among astonished boughs—
2090,166,how many trips the tortoise makes—
2091,166,"how many cups the bee partakes,"
2092,166,the debauchee of dews!
2093,166,"also, who laid the rainbow's piers,"
2094,166,"also, who leads the docile spheres"
2095,166,by withes of supple blue?
2096,166,whose fingers string the stalactite—
2097,166,who counts the wampum of the night
2098,166,to see that none is due?
2099,166,who built this little alban house
2100,166,and shut the windows down so close
2101,166,my spirit cannot see?
2102,166,who'll let me out some gala day
2103,166,"with implements to fly away,"
2104,166,passing pomposity?
2105,167,but little carmine hath her face—
2106,167,of emerald scant—her gown—
2107,167,her beauty—is the love she doth—
2108,167,itself—exhibit—mine—
2109,168,by a flower—by a letter—
2110,168,by a nimble love—
2111,168,if i weld the rivet faster—
2112,168,final fast—above—
2113,168,never mind my breathless anvil!
2114,168,never mind repose!
2115,168,never mind the sooty faces
2116,168,tugging at the forge!
2117,169,"by chivalries as tiny,"
2118,169,"a blossom, or a book,"
2119,169,the seeds of smiles are planted—
2120,169,which blossom in the dark.
2121,170,by my window have i for scenery
2122,170,just a sea—with a stem—
2123,170,"if the bird and the farmer—deem it a ""pine""—"
2124,170,the opinion will serve—for them—
2125,170,"it has no port, nor a ""line""—but the jays—"
2126,170,that split their route to the sky—
2127,170,"or a squirrel, whose giddy peninsula"
2128,170,may be easier reached—this way—
2129,170,for inlands—the earth is the under side—
2130,170,and the upper side—is the sun—
2131,170,and its commerce—if commerce it have—
2132,170,of spice—i infer from the odors borne—
2133,170,of its voice—to affirm—when the wind is within—
2134,170,can the dumb—define the divine?
2135,170,the definition of melody—is—
2136,170,that definition is none—
2137,170,it—suggests to our faith—
2138,170,they—suggest to our sight—
2139,170,when the latter—is put away
2140,170,i shall meet with conviction i somewhere met
2141,170,that immortality—
2142,170,"was the pine at my window a ""fellow"
2143,170,"of the royal"" infinity?"
2144,170,apprehensions—are god's introductions—
2145,170,to be hallowed—accordingly—
2146,171,by such and such an offering
2147,171,"to mr. so and so,"
2148,171,the web of live woven—
2149,171,so martyrs albums show!
2150,172,"i started early, took my dog,"
2151,172,and visited the sea;
2152,172,the mermaids in the basement
2153,172,came out to look at me.
2154,172,and frigates in the upper floor
2155,172,"extended hempen hands,"
2156,172,presuming me to be a mouse
2157,172,"aground, upon the sands."
2158,172,but no man moved me till the tide
2159,172,"went past my simple shoe,"
2160,172,"and past my apron and my belt,"
2161,172,"and past my bodice too,"
2162,172,and made as he would eat me up
2163,172,as wholly as a dew
2164,172,upon a dandelion's sleeve -
2165,172,and then i started too.
2166,172,and he - he followed close behind;
2167,172,i felt his silver heel
2168,172,"upon my ankle, - then my shoes"
2169,172,would overflow with pearl.
2170,172,"until we met the solid town,"
2171,172,no man he seemed to know;
2172,172,and bowing with a mighty look
2173,172,"at me, the sea withdrew."
2174,173,she sights a bird - she chuckles -
2175,173,she flattens - then she crawls -
2176,173,she runs without the look of feet -
2177,173,her eyes increase to balls -
2178,173,her jaws stir - twitching - hungry -
2179,173,her teeth can hardly stand -
2180,173,"she leaps, but robin leaped the first -"
2181,173,"ah, pussy, of the sand,"
2182,173,the hopes so juicy ripening -
2183,173,you almost bathed your tongue -
2184,173,when bliss disclosed a hundred toes -
2185,173,and fled with every one -
2186,174,"i never saw a moor,  "
2187,174,i never saw the sea;  
2188,174,"yet now i know how the heather looks,  "
2189,174,and what a wave must be.  
2190,174,"i never spoke with god,"
2191,174,nor visited in heaven;  
2192,174,yet certain am i of the spot  
2193,174,as if the chart were given.
2194,175,civilization—spurns—the leopard!
2195,175,was the leopard—bold?
2196,175,deserts—never rebuked her satin—
2197,175,ethiop—her gold—
2198,175,tawny—her customs—
2199,175,she was conscious—
2200,175,spotted—her dun gown—
2201,175,this was the leopard's nature—signor—
2202,175,need—a keeper—frown?
2203,175,pity—the pard—that left her asia—
2204,175,memories—of palm—
2205,175,cannot be stifled—with narcotic—
2206,175,nor suppressed—with balm—
2207,176,cocoon above! cocoon below!
2208,176,"stealthy cocoon, why hide you so"
2209,176,what all the world suspect?
2210,176,"an hour, and gay on every tree"
2211,176,"your secret, perched in ecstasy"
2212,176,defies imprisonment!
2213,176,"an hour in chrysalis to pass,"
2214,176,then gay above receding grass
2215,176,a butterfly to go!
2216,176,"a moment to interrogate,"
2217,176,"then wiser than a ""surrogate,"""
2218,176,the universe to know!
2219,177,color—caste—denomination—
2220,177,these—are time's affair—
2221,177,death's diviner classifying
2222,177,does not know they are—
2223,177,as in sleep—all hue forgotten—
2224,177,tenets—put behind—
2225,177,death's large—democratic fingers
2226,177,rub away the brand—
2227,177,if circassian—he is careless—
2228,177,if he put away
2229,177,chrysalis of blonde—or umber—
2230,177,equal butterfly—
2231,177,they emerge from his obscuring—
2232,177,what death—knows so well—
2233,177,our minuter intuitions—
2234,177,deem unplausible—
2235,178,come slowly—eden!
2236,178,lips unused to thee—
2237,178,bashful—sip thy jessamines—
2238,178,as the fainting bee—
2239,178,"reaching late his flower,"
2240,178,round her chamber hums—
2241,178,counts his nectars—
2242,178,enters—and is lost in balms.
2243,179,conjecturing a climate
2244,179,of unsuspended suns—
2245,179,adds poignancy to winter—
2246,179,the shivering fancy turns
2247,179,to a fictitious country
2248,179,to palliate a cold—
2249,179,not obviated of degree—
2250,179,nor erased—of latitude—
2251,180,"conscious am i in my chamber,"
2252,180,of a shapeless friend—
2253,180,he doth not attest by posture—
2254,180,nor confirm—by word—
2255,180,neither place—need i present him—
2256,180,fitter courtesy
2257,180,hospitable intuition
2258,180,of his company—
2259,180,presence—is his furthest license—
2260,180,neither he to me
2261,180,nor myself to him—by accent—
2262,180,forfeit probity—
2263,180,"weariness of him, were quainter"
2264,180,than monotony
2265,180,knew a particle—of space's
2266,180,vast society
2267,180,neither if he visit other—
2268,180,do he dwell—or nay—know i—
2269,180,but instinct esteem him
2270,180,immortality—
2271,181,could i but ride indefinite
2272,181,as doth the meadow bee
2273,181,and visit only where i liked
2274,181,and no one visit me
2275,181,and flirt all day with buttercups
2276,181,and marry whom i may
2277,181,and dwell a little everywhere
2278,181,"or better, run away"
2279,181,with no police to follow
2280,181,or chase him if he do
2281,181,till he should jump peninsulas
2282,181,to get away from me—
2283,181,"i said ""but just to be a bee"""
2284,181,upon a raft of air
2285,181,and row in nowhere all day long
2286,181,"and anchor ""off the bar"""
2287,181,what liberty! so captives deem
2288,181,who tight in dungeons are.
2289,182,could i—then—shut the door—
2290,182,lest my beseeching face—at last—
2291,182,rejected—be—of her?
2292,183,could live—did live—
2293,183,could die—did die—
2294,183,could smile upon the whole
2295,183,"through faith in one he met not,"
2296,183,to introduce his soul.
2297,183,could go from scene familiar
2298,183,to an untraversed spot—
2299,183,could contemplate the journey
2300,183,with unpuzzled heart—
2301,183,"such trust had one among us,"
2302,183,among us not today—
2303,183,we who saw the launching
2304,183,never sailed the bay!
2305,184,could—i do more—for thee—
2306,184,wert thou a bumble bee—
2307,184,"since for the queen, have i—"
2308,184,nought but bouquet?
2309,185,crisis is a hair
2310,185,toward which the forces creep
2311,185,past which forces retrograde
2312,185,if it come in sleep
2313,185,to suspend the breath
2314,185,is the most we can
2315,185,ignorant is it life or death
2316,185,nicely balancing.
2317,185,let an instant push
2318,185,or an atom press
2319,185,or a circle hesitate
2320,185,in circumference
2321,185,it—may jolt the hand
2322,185,that adjusts the hair
2323,185,that secures eternity
2324,185,from presenting—here—
2325,186,crumbling is not an instant's act
2326,186,a fundamental pause
2327,186,dilapidation's processes
2328,186,are organized decays.
2329,186,'tis first a cobweb on the soul
2330,186,a cuticle of dust
2331,186,a borer in the axis
2332,186,an elemental rust—
2333,186,ruin is formal—devil's work
2334,186,consecutive and slow—
2335,186,"fail in an instant, no man did"
2336,186,slipping—is crash's law.
2337,187,dare you see a soul at the white heat?
2338,187,then crouch within the door—
2339,187,red—is the fire's common tint—
2340,187,but when the vivid ore
2341,187,"has vanquished flame's conditions,"
2342,187,it quivers from the forge
2343,187,"without a color, but the light"
2344,187,of unanointed blaze.
2345,187,least village has its blacksmith
2346,187,whose anvil's even ring
2347,187,stands symbol for the finer forge
2348,187,that soundless tugs—within—
2349,187,refining these impatient ores
2350,187,"with hammer, and with blaze"
2351,187,until the designated light
2352,187,repudiate the forge—
2353,188,death is a dialogue between
2354,188,the spirit and the dust.
2355,188,"""dissolve"" says death—the spirit ""sir"
2356,188,"i have another trust""—"
2357,188,death doubts it—argues from the ground—
2358,188,the spirit turns away
2359,188,just laying off for evidence
2360,188,an overcoat of clay.
2361,189,death is potential to that man
2362,189,who dies—and to his friend—
2363,189,beyond that—unconspicuous
2364,189,to anyone but god—
2365,189,of these two—god remembers
2366,189,the longest—for the friend—
2367,189,is integral—and therefore
2368,189,itself dissolved—of god—
2369,190,"death leaves us homesick, who behind,"
2370,190,except that it is gone
2371,190,are ignorant of its concern
2372,190,as if it were not born.
2373,190,"through all their former places, we"
2374,190,like individuals go
2375,190,"who something lost, the seeking for"
2376,190,"is all that's left them, now—"
2377,191,death sets a thing significant
2378,191,the eye had hurried by
2379,191,except a perished creature
2380,191,entreat us tenderly
2381,191,to ponder little workmanships
2382,191,"in crayon, or in wool,"
2383,191,"with ""this was last her fingers did""—"
2384,191,industrious until—
2385,191,the thimble weighed too heavy—
2386,191,the stitches stopped—by themselves—
2387,191,and then 'twas put among the dust
2388,191,upon the closet shelves—
2389,191,a book i have—a friend gave—
2390,191,whose pencil—here and there—
2391,191,had notched the place that pleased him—
2392,191,at rest—his fingers are—
2393,191,now—when i read—i read not—
2394,191,for interrupting tears—
2395,191,obliterate the etchings
2396,191,too costly for repairs.
2397,192,defrauded i a butterfly—
2398,192,the lawful heir—for thee—
2399,193,delayed till she had ceased to know—
2400,193,delayed till in its vest of snow
2401,193,her loving bosom lay—
2402,193,an hour behind the fleeting breath—
2403,193,later by just an hour than death—
2404,193,oh lagging yesterday!
2405,193,could she have guessed that it would be—
2406,193,could but a crier of the joy
2407,193,have climbed the distant hill—
2408,193,had not the bliss so slow a pace
2409,193,who knows but this surrendered face
2410,193,were undefeated still?
2411,193,oh if there may departing be
2412,193,any forgot by victory
2413,193,in her imperial round—
2414,193,show them this meek appareled thing
2415,193,that could not stop to be a king—
2416,193,doubtful if it be crowned!
2417,194,delight becomes pictorial
2418,194,"when viewed through pain, "
2419,194,"more fair, because impossible"
2420,194,that any gain.
2421,194,the mountain at a given distance
2422,194,in amber lies;
2423,194,"approached, the amber flits a little, "
2424,194,and that's the skies!
2425,195,delight is as the flight—
2426,195,"or in the ratio of it,"
2427,195,as the schools would say—
2428,195,the rainbow's way—
2429,195,a skein
2430,195,"flung colored, after rain,"
2431,195,"would suit as bright,"
2432,195,except that flight
2433,195,were aliment—
2434,195,"""if it would last"""
2435,195,"i asked the east,"
2436,195,when that bent stripe
2437,195,struck up my childish
2438,195,firmament—
2439,195,"and i, for glee,"
2440,195,"took rainbows, as the common way,"
2441,195,and empty skies
2442,195,the eccentricity—
2443,195,and so with lives—
2444,195,and so with butterflies—
2445,195,seen magic—through the fright
2446,195,that they will cheat the sight—
2447,195,and dower latitudes far on—
2448,195,some sudden morn—
2449,195,our portion—in the fashion—
2450,195,done—
2451,196,denial—is the only fact
2452,196,perceived by the denied—
2453,196,whose will—a numb significance—
2454,196,the day the heaven died—
2455,196,and all the earth strove common round—
2456,196,"without delight, or beam—"
2457,196,what comfort was it wisdom—was—
2458,196,the spoiler of our home?
2459,197,"departed to the judgment,"
2460,197,a mighty afternoon;
2461,197,"great clouds like ushers leaning,"
2462,197,creation looking on.
2463,197,"the flesh surrendered, cancelled"
2464,197,the bodiless begun;
2465,197,"two worlds, like audiences, disperse"
2466,197,and leave the soul alone.
2467,198,"deprived of other banquet,"
2468,198,i entertained myself—
2469,198,at first—a scant nutrition—
2470,198,an insufficient loaf—
2471,198,but grown by slender addings
2472,198,to so esteemed a size
2473,198,'tis sumptuous enough for me—
2474,198,and almost to suffice
2475,198,a robin's famine able—
2476,198,"red pilgrim, he and i—"
2477,198,a berry from our table
2478,198,reserve—for charity—
2479,199,despair's advantage is achieved
2480,199,by suffering—despair—
2481,199,to be assisted of reverse
2482,199,one must reverse have bore—
2483,199,the worthiness of suffering like
2484,199,the worthiness of death
2485,199,is ascertained by tasting—
2486,199,as can no other mouth
2487,199,of savors—make us conscious—
2488,199,as did ourselves partake—
2489,199,affliction feels impalpable
2490,199,until ourselves are struck—
2491,200,did our best moment last—
2492,200,'twould supersede the heaven—

2495,200,except as stimulants—in
2496,200,cases of despair—
2497,200,or stupor—the reserve—
2498,200,these heavenly moments are—
2499,200,a grant of the divine—
2500,200,that certain as it comes—
2501,200,withdraws—and leaves the dazzled soul
2502,200,in her unfurnished rooms
2503,201,did the harebell loose her girdle
2504,201,to the lover bee
2505,201,would the bee the harebell hallow
2506,201,much as formerly?
2507,201,"did the ""paradise""—persuaded—"
2508,201,yield her moat of pearl—
2509,201,"would the eden be an eden,"
2510,201,or the earl—an earl?
2511,202,did we disobey him?
2512,202,just one time!
2513,202,charged us to forget him—
2514,202,but we couldn't learn!
2515,202,were himself—such a dunce—
2516,202,what would we—do?
2517,202,love the dull lad—best—
2518,202,"oh, wouldn't you?"
2519,203,did you ever stand in a cavern's mouth—
2520,203,widths out of the sun—
2521,203,"and look—and shudder, and block your breath—"
2522,203,and deem to be alone
2523,203,"in such a place, what horror,"
2524,203,how goblin it would be—
2525,203,"and fly, as 'twere pursuing you?"
2526,203,then loneliness—looks so—
2527,203,did you ever look in a cannon's face—
2528,203,between whose yellow eye—
2529,203,and yours—the judgment intervened—
2530,203,"the question of ""to die""—"
2531,203,extemporizing in your ear
2532,203,as cool as satyr's drums—
2533,203,"if you remember, and were saved—"
2534,203,it's liker so—it seems—
2535,204,distrustful of the gentian—

2541,204,i shall not feel the sleet—then—
2542,204,i shall not fear the snow.
2543,204,flees so the phantom meadow
2544,204,before the breathless bee—
2545,204,so bubble brooks in deserts
2546,204,on ears that dying lie—
2547,204,burn so the evening spires
2548,204,to eyes that closing go—
2549,204,hangs so distant heaven—
2550,204,to a hand below.

2560,205,that there be standing here—
2561,205,"a sort, that shall not taste of death—"
2562,205,if jesus was sincere—
2563,205,i need no further argue—
2564,205,that statement of the lord
2565,205,is not a controvertible—
2566,205,"he told me, death was dead—"
2567,206,don't put up my thread and needle—
2568,206,i'll begin to sew
2569,206,when the birds begin to whistle—
2570,206,better stitches—so—
2571,206,these were bent—my sight got crooked—
2572,206,when my mind—is plain
2573,206,i'll do seams—a queen's endeavor
2574,206,would not blush to own—
2575,206,hems—too fine for lady's tracing
2576,206,to the sightless knot—
2577,206,tucks—of dainty interspersion—
2578,206,like a dotted dot—
2579,206,leave my needle in the furrow—
2580,206,where i put it down—
2581,206,i can make the zigzag stitches
2582,206,straight—when i am strong—
2583,206,till then—dreaming i am sewing

2585,206,closer—so i—at my sleeping—

2589,207,"and then the ladder's thrown away,"
2590,207,because escape—is done—
2591,207,'tis varied by the dream
2592,207,of what they do outside—
2593,207,where squirrels play—and berries die—
2594,207,and hemlocks—bow—to god—
2595,208,doubt me! my dim companion!
2596,208,"why, god, would be content"
2597,208,with but a fraction of the life—
2598,208,"poured thee, without a stint—"
2599,208,the whole of me—forever—
2600,208,"what more the woman can,"
2601,208,"say quick, that i may dower thee"
2602,208,with last delight i own!
2603,208,it cannot be my spirit—
2604,208,"for that was thine, before—"
2605,208,i ceded all of dust i knew—
2606,208,what opulence the more
2607,208,"had i—a freckled maiden,"
2608,208,"whose farthest of degree,"
2609,208,was—that she might—

2685,214,  between the light and me;
2686,214,"  and then the windows failed, and then"
2687,214,  i could not see to see.
2688,215,dying! dying in the night!
2689,215,won't somebody bring the light
2690,215,so i can see which way to go
2691,215,into the everlasting snow?
2692,215,"and ""jesus""! where is jesus gone?"
2693,215,they said that jesus—always came—

2700,216,dying! to be afraid of thee
2701,216,one must to thine artillery
2702,216,have left exposed a friend—
2703,216,than thine old arrow is a shot
2704,216,delivered straighter to the heart
2705,216,the leaving love behind.

2742,219,just measuring unconsciousness
2743,219,the sea and spar between.
2744,219,to fail within a chance—
2745,219,how terribler a thing
2746,219,than perish from the chance's list
2747,219,before the perishing!
2748,220,embarrassment of one another
2749,220,and god
2750,220,"is revelation's limit,"
2751,220,aloud
2752,220,"is nothing that is chief,"

2754,220,divinity dwells under a seal.
2755,221,"empty my heart, of thee—"
2756,221,its single artery—

2758,221,simply extinction's date—

2760,221,one baltic—they—
2761,221,"subtract thyself, in play,"

2768,221,"eternity's vast pocket, picked—"
2769,222,endow the living—with the tears—
2770,222,"you squander on the dead,"
2771,222,"and they were men and women—now,"
2772,222,around your fireside—
2773,222,"instead of passive creatures,"
2774,222,denied the cherishing
2775,222,till they—the cherishing deny—
2776,222,with death's ethereal scron—
2777,223,escaping backward to perceive
2778,223,the sea upon our place—
2779,223,"escaping forward, to confront"
2780,223,his glittering embrace—
2781,223,"retreating up, a billow's height"
2782,223,retreating blinded down
2783,223,our undermining feet to meet
2784,223,instructs to the divine.

2788,224,it is the gift of screws—
2789,224,the general rose—decay—
2790,224,but this—in lady's drawer
2791,224,make summer—when the lady lie
2792,224,in ceaseless rosemary—
2793,225,except the heaven had come so near—
2794,225,so seemed to choose my door—
2795,225,the distance would not haunt me so—
2796,225,i had not hoped—before—
2797,225,but just to hear the grace depart—
2798,225,i never thought to see—
2799,225,afflicts me with a double loss—
2800,225,'tis lost—and lost to me—
2801,226,"except to heaven, she is nought."
2802,226,except for angels—lone.
2803,226,except to some wide-wandering bee
2804,226,a flower superfluous blown.
2805,226,except for winds—provincial.
2806,226,except by butterflies
2807,226,unnoticed as a single dew
2808,226,that on the acre lies.
2809,226,"the smallest housewife in the grass,"
2810,226,yet take her from the lawn
2811,226,and somebody has lost the face
2812,226,that made existence—home!
2813,227,"the soul selects her own society,"
2814,227,   then shuts the door;

2828,228,as that diviner brand
2829,228,the soul achieves—herself—
2830,228,to drink—or set away
2831,228,for visitor—or sacrament—
2832,228,'tis not of holiday
2833,228,to stimulate a man
2834,228,who hath the ample rhine
2835,228,within his closet—best you can
2836,228,exhale in offering.
2837,229,expectation—is contentment—
2838,229,gain—satiety—
2839,229,but satiety—conviction
2840,229,of necessity
2841,229,of an austere trait in pleasure—
2842,229,"good, without alarm"
2843,229,is a too established fortune—

2849,230,quite opposite—how complicate
2850,230,the discipline of man—
2851,230,compelling him to choose himself
2852,230,his preappointed pain—
2853,231,exultation is the going
2854,231,"of an inland soul to sea,"
2855,231,past the houses—past the headlands—
2856,231,into deep eternity—
2857,231,"bred as we, among the mountains,"

2870,233,when gentlemen can see—
2871,233,but microscopes are prudent
2872,233,in an emergency.
2873,234,faith—is the pierless bridge
2874,234,supporting what we see
2875,234,unto the scene that we do not—
2876,234,too slender for the eye
2877,234,it bears the soul as bold
2878,234,as it were rocked in steel
2879,234,with arms of steel at either side—
2880,234,it joins—behind the veil
2881,234,"to what, could we presume"
2882,234,the bridge would cease to be
2883,234,"to our far, vacillating feet"
2884,234,a first necessity.
2885,235,fame is a bee.
2886,235,it has a song—
2887,235,it has a sting—
2888,235,"ah, too, it has a wing."
2889,236,fame is a fickle food
2890,236,upon a shifting plate
2891,236,whose table once a
2892,236,guest but not
2893,236,the second time is set.
2894,236,whose crumbs the crows inspect
2895,236,and with ironic caw
2896,236,flap past it to the
2897,236,farmer's corn—
2898,236,men eat of it and die.
2899,237,fame is the tine that scholars leave
2900,237,upon their setting names—
2901,237,the iris not of occident
2902,237,that disappears as comes—
2903,238,"fame of myself, to justify,"
2904,238,all other plaudit be
2905,238,superfluous—an incense
2906,238,beyond necessity—
2907,238,fame of myself to lack—although
2908,238,my name be else supreme—
2909,238,this were an honor honorless—
2910,238,a futile diadem—
2911,239,finding is the first act

2919,240,"finite—to fail, but infinite to venture—"
2920,240,for the one ship that struts the shore
2921,240,many's the gallant—overwhelmed creature
2922,240,nodding in navies nevermore—
2923,241,"i dreaded that first robin so,"
2924,241,"but he is mastered now,"
2925,241,"and i'm accustomed to him grown, "
2926,241,"he hurts a little, though."
2927,241,i thought if i could only live
2928,241,"till that first shout got by,"
2929,241,not all pianos in the woods
2930,241,had power to mangle me.
2931,241,"i dared not meet the daffodils,"
2932,241,for fear their yellow gown
2933,241,would pierce me with a fashion
2934,241,so foreign to my own.
2935,241,"i wished the grass would hurry,"
2936,241,"so when 't was time to see,"
2937,241,"he'd be too tall, the tallest one"
2938,241,could stretch to look at me.
2939,241,"i could not bear the bees should come,"
2940,241,i wished they'd stay away
2941,241,"in those dim countries where they go,"
2942,241,what word had they for me?
2943,241,"they're here, though; not a creature failed,"
2944,241,no blossom stayed away
2945,241,"in gentle deference to me,"
2946,241,the queen of calvary.
2947,241,"each one salutes me as he goes,"
2948,241,and i my childish plumes
2949,241,"lift, in bereaved acknowledgment"
2950,241,of their unthinking drums.
2951,242,"fitter to see him, i may be"
2952,242,for the long hindrance—grace—to me—
2953,242,"with summers, and with winters, grow,"
2954,242,some passing year—a trait bestow
2955,242,to make me fairest of the earth—
2956,242,the waiting—then—will seem so worth
2957,242,i shall impute with half a pain
2958,242,the blame that i was chosen—then—
2959,242,time to anticipate his gaze—
2960,242,it's first—delight—and then—surprise—
2961,242,the turning o'er and o'er my face
2962,242,for evidence it be the grace—
2963,242,he left behind one day—so less
2964,242,"he seek conviction, that—be this—"
2965,242,i only must not grow so new
2966,242,that he'll mistake—and ask for me
2967,242,of me—when first unto the door
2968,242,i go—to elsewhere go no more—
2969,242,i only must not change so fair
2970,242,"he'll sigh—""the other—she—is where?"""
2971,242,"the love, tho', will array me right"
2972,242,i shall be perfect—in his sight—
2973,242,if he perceive the other truth—
2974,242,upon an excellenter youth—
2975,242,how sweet i shall not lack in vain—
2976,242,but gain—thro' loss—through grief—obtain—
2977,242,the beauty that reward him best—
2978,242,the beauty of demand—at rest—
2979,243,flowers—well—if anybody
2980,243,can the ecstasy define—
2981,243,half a transport—half a trouble—
2982,243,"with which flowers humble men,"
2983,243,anybody find the fountain
2984,243,from which floods so contra flow—
2985,243,i will give him all the daisies
2986,243,which upon the hillside blow.
2987,243,too much pathos in their faces
2988,243,for a simple breast like mine—
2989,243,butterflies from st. domingo
2990,243,cruising round the purple line—
2991,243,have a system of aesthetics—
2992,243,far superior to mine.
2993,244,for death—or rather
2994,244,for the things 'twould buy—
2995,244,this—put away
2996,244,life's opportunity—
2997,244,the things that death will buy
2998,244,are room—
2999,244,escape from circumstances—
3000,244,and a name—
3001,244,with gifts of life
3002,244,how death's gifts may compare—
3003,244,we know not—
3004,244,for the rates—lie here—
3005,245,for each ecstatic instant
3006,245,we must an anguish pay
3007,245,in keen and quivering ratio
3008,245,to the ecstasy.
3009,245,for each beloved hour
3010,245,"sharp pittances of years,"
3011,245,bitter contested farthings
3012,245,and coffers heaped with tears.
3013,246,for every bird a nest—
3014,246,wherefore in timid quest
3015,246,some little wren goes seeking round—
3016,246,wherefore when boughs are free—
3017,246,households in every tree—
3018,246,pilgrim be found?
3019,246,perhaps a home too high—
3020,246,ah aristocracy!
3021,246,the little wren desires—
3022,246,perhaps of twig so fine—
3023,246,"of twine e'en superfine,"
3024,246,her pride aspires—
3025,246,the lark is not ashamed
3026,246,to build upon the ground
3027,246,her modest house—
3028,246,yet who of all the throng
3029,246,dancing around the sun
3030,246,does so rejoice?
3031,247,for largest woman's hearth i knew—
3032,247,'tis little i can do—
3033,247,and yet the largest woman's heart
3034,247,could hold an arrow—too—
3035,247,"and so, instructed by my own,"
3036,247,"i tenderer, turn me to."
3037,248,for this—accepted breath—
3038,248,through it—compete with death—
3039,248,the fellow cannot touch this crown—
3040,248,by it—my title take—
3041,248,"ah, what a royal sake"
3042,248,to my necessity—stooped down!
3043,248,no wilderness—can be
3044,248,where this attendeth me—
3045,248,no desert noon—
3046,248,no fear of frost to come
3047,248,haunt the perennial bloom—
3048,248,but certain june!
3049,248,get gabriel—to tell—the royal syllable—
3050,248,get saints—with new—unsteady tongue—
3051,248,to say what trance below
3052,248,most like their glory show—
3053,248,fittest the crown!
3054,249,forever at his side to walk—
3055,249,the smaller of the two!
3056,249,brain of his brain—
3057,249,blood of his blood—
3058,249,two lives—one being—now—
3059,249,forever of his fate to taste—
3060,249,if grief—the largest part—
3061,249,if joy—to put my piece away
3062,249,for that beloved heart—
3063,249,all life—to know each other—
3064,249,whom we can never learn—
3065,249,and bye and bye—a change—
3066,249,called heaven—
3067,249,rapt neighborhoods of men—
3068,249,just finding out—what puzzled us—
3069,249,without the lexicon!
3070,250,forever—it composed of nows—
3071,250,'tis not a different time—
3072,250,except for infiniteness—
3073,250,and latitude of home—

3075,250,remove the dates—to these—
3076,250,let months dissolve in further months—
3077,250,and years—exhale in years—
3078,250,without debate—or pause—
3079,250,or celebrated days—
3080,250,no different our years would be
3081,250,from anno domini's—
3082,251,forget! the lady with the amulet
3083,251,forget she wore it at her heart
3084,251,because she breathed against
3085,251,was treason twixt?
3086,251,deny! did rose her bee—
3087,251,for privilege of play
3088,251,or wile of butterfly
3089,251,or opportunity—her lord away?
3090,251,the lady with the amulet—will face—
3091,251,the bee—in mausoleum laid—
3092,251,discard his bride—
3093,251,but longer than the little rill—
3094,251,that cooled the forehead of the hill—
3095,251,while other—went the sea to fill—
3096,251,and other—went to turn the mill—
3097,251,i'll do thy will—
3098,252,four trees—upon a solitary acre—
3099,252,without design
3100,252,"or order, or apparent action—"
3101,252,maintain—
3102,252,the sun—upon a morning meets them—
3103,252,the wind—
3104,252,no nearer neighbor—have they—
3105,252,but god—
3106,252,the acre gives them—place—
3107,252,they—him—attention of passer by—
3108,252,"of shadow, or of squirrel, haply—"
3109,252,or boy—
3110,252,what deed is theirs unto the general nature—
3111,252,what plan
3112,252,they severally—retard—or further—
3113,252,unknown—
3114,253,frequently the wood are pink—
3115,253,frequently are brown.
3116,253,frequently the hills undress
3117,253,behind my native town.
3118,253,oft a head is crested
3119,253,i was wont to see—
3120,253,and as oft a cranny
3121,253,where it used to be—
3122,253,and the earth— they tell me—
3123,253,on its axis turned!
3124,253,wonderful rotation!
3125,253,by but twelve performed!
3126,254,from blank to blank—
3127,254,a threadless way
3128,254,i pushed mechanic feet—
3129,254,to stop—or perish—or advance—
3130,254,alike indifferent—
3131,254,if end i gained
3132,254,it ends beyond
3133,254,indefinite disclosed—
3134,254,i shut my eyes—and groped as well
3135,254,'twas lighter—to be blind—
3136,255,from cocoon forth a butterfly
3137,255,as lady from her door
3138,255,emerged—a summer afternoon—
3139,255,repairing everywhere—
3140,255,without design—that i could trace
3141,255,except to stray abroad
3142,255,on miscellaneous enterprise
3143,255,the clovers—understood—
3144,255,her pretty parasol be seen
3145,255,contracting in a field
3146,255,where men made hay—
3147,255,then struggling hard
3148,255,with an opposing cloud—
3149,255,where parties—phantom as herself—
3150,255,to nowhere—seemed to go
3151,255,in purposeless circumference—
3152,255,as 'twere a tropic show—
3153,255,and notwithstanding bee—that worked—
3154,255,and flower—that zealous blew—
3155,255,this audience of idleness
3156,255,"disdained them, from the sky—"
3157,255,till sundown crept—a steady tide—
3158,255,and men that made the hay—
3159,255,and afternoon—and butterfly—
3160,255,extinguished—in the sea—
3161,256,"from us she wandered now a year,"
3162,256,"her tarrying, unknown,"
3163,256,if wilderness prevent her feet
3164,256,or that ethereal zone
3165,256,no eye hath seen and lived
3166,256,we ignorant must be—
3167,256,we only know what time of year
3168,256,we took the mystery.
3169,257,funny—to be a century—
3170,257,and see the people—going by—
3171,257,i—should die of the oddity—
3172,257,but then—i'm not so staid—as he—
3173,257,he keeps his secrets safely—very—
3174,257,were he to tell—extremely sorry
3175,257,this bashful globe of ours would be—
3176,257,so dainty of publicity—
3177,258,further in summer than the birds
3178,258,pathetic from the grass
3179,258,a minor nation celebrates
3180,258,its unobtrusive mass.
3181,258,no ordinance be seen
3182,258,so gradual the grace
3183,258,a pensive custom it becomes
3184,258,enlarging loneliness.
3185,258,antiquest felt at noon
3186,258,when august burning low

3191,258,yet a druidic difference
3192,258,enhances nature now
3193,259,"garland for queens, may be—"
3194,259,laurels—for rare degree
3195,259,of soul or sword.
3196,259,ah—but remembering me—
3197,259,ah—but remembering thee—
3198,259,nature in chivalry—
3199,259,nature in charity—
3200,259,nature in equity—
3201,259,this rose ordained!
3202,260,give little anguish—
3203,260,lives will fret—
3204,260,give avalanches—
3205,260,and they'll slant—
3206,260,straighten—look cautious for their breath—
3207,260,but make no syllable—like death—
3208,260,who only shows the marble disc—
3209,260,sublimer sort—than speech—
3210,261,given in marriage unto thee
3211,261,oh thou celestial host—
3212,261,bride of the father and the son
3213,261,bride of the holy ghost.
3214,261,other betrothal shall dissolve—
3215,261,"wedlock of will, decay—"
3216,261,only the keeper of this ring
3217,261,conquer mortality—
3218,262,glee—the great storm is over—
3219,262,four—have recovered the land—
3220,262,forty—gone down together—
3221,262,into the boiling sand—
3222,262,ring—for the scant salvation—
3223,262,toll—for the bonnie souls—
3224,262,neighbor—and friend—and bridegroom—
3225,262,spinning upon the shoals—
3226,262,how they will tell the story—
3227,262,when winter shake the door—
3228,262,till the children urge—
3229,262,but the forty—
3230,262,did they—come back no more?
3231,262,then a softness—suffuse the story—
3232,262,and a silence—the teller's eye—
3233,262,and the children—no further question—
3234,262,and only the sea—reply—
3235,263,"glowing is her bonnet,"
3236,263,"glowing is her cheek,"
3237,263,"glowing is her kirtle,"
3238,263,yet she cannot speak.
3239,263,better as the daisy
3240,263,from the summer hill
3241,263,vanish unrecorded
3242,263,save by tearful rill—
3243,263,save by loving sunrise
3244,263,looking for her face.
3245,263,save by feet unnumbered
3246,263,pausing at the place.
3247,264,god gave a loaf to every bird—
3248,264,but just a crumb—to me—
3249,264,i dare not eat it—tho' i starve—
3250,264,my poignant luxury—
3251,264,to own it—touch it—
3252,264,prove the feat—that made the pellet mine—
3253,264,too happy—for my sparrow's chance—
3254,264,for ampler coveting—
3255,264,it might be famine—all around—
3256,264,i could not miss an ear—
3257,264,such plenty smiles upon my board—
3258,264,my garner shows so fair—
3259,264,i wonder how the rich—may feel—
3260,264,an indiaman—an earl—
3261,264,i deem that i—with but a crumb—
3262,264,am sovereign of them all—
3263,265,god is a distant—stately lover—
3264,265,"woos, as he states us—by his son—"
3265,265,"verily, a vicarious courtship—"
3266,265,"""miles"", and ""priscilla"", were such an one—"
3267,265,"but, lest the soul—like fair ""priscilla"""
3268,265,choose the envoy—and spurn the groom—
3269,265,"vouches, with hyperbolic archness—"
3270,265,"""miles"", and ""john alden"" were synonym—"
3271,266,god made a little gentian—
3272,266,it tried—to be a rose—
3273,266,and failed—and all the summer laughed—
3274,266,but just before the snows
3275,266,there rose a purple creature—
3276,266,that ravished all the hill—
3277,266,and summer hid her forehead—
3278,266,and mockery—was still—
3279,266,the frosts were her condition—
3280,266,the tyrian would not come
3281,266,until the north—invoke it—
3282,266,creator—shall i—bloom?
3283,267,god permit industrious angels
3284,267,afternoons to play.
3285,267,"i met one,   forgot my school-mates,"
3286,267,"all, for him, straightaway."
3287,267,god calls home the angels promptly
3288,267,at the setting sun;
3289,267,"i missed mine. how dreary marbles,"
3290,267,after playing the crown!
3291,268,going to heaven!
3292,268,i don't know when—
3293,268,pray do not ask me how!
3294,268,indeed i'm too astonished
3295,268,to think of answering you!
3296,268,going to heaven!
3297,268,how dim it sounds!
3298,268,and yet it will be done
3299,268,as sure as flocks go home at night
3300,268,unto the shepherd's arm!
3301,268,perhaps you're going too!
3302,268,who knows?
3303,268,if you should get there first
3304,268,save just a little space for me
3305,268,close to the two i lost—
3306,268,"the smallest ""robe"" will fit me"
3307,268,"and just a bit of ""crown""—"
3308,268,for you know we do not mind our dress
3309,268,when we are going home—
3310,268,i'm glad i don't believe it
3311,268,for it would stop my breath—
3312,268,and i'd like to look a little more
3313,268,at such a curious earth!
3314,268,i'm glad they did believe it
3315,268,whom i have never found
3316,268,since the might autumn afternoon
3317,268,i left them in the ground.
3318,269,going to him! happy letter!
3319,269,tell him—
3320,269,tell him the page i didn't write—
3321,269,tell him—i only said the syntax—
3322,269,and left the verb and the pronoun out—
3323,269,tell him just how the fingers hurried—
3324,269,then—how they waded—slow—slow—
3325,269,and then you wished you had eyes in your pages—
3326,269,so you could see what moved them so—
3327,269,tell him—it wasn't a practised writer—
3328,269,you guessed—from the way the sentence toiled—
3329,269,"you could hear the bodice tug, behind you—"
3330,269,as if it held but the might of a child—
3331,269,you almost pitied it—you—it worked so—
3332,269,tell him—no—you may quibble there—
3333,269,"for it would split his heart, to know it—"
3334,269,"and then you and i, were silenter."
3335,269,tell him—night finished—before we finished—
3336,269,"and the old clock kept neighing ""day""!"
3337,269,and you—got sleepy—and begged to be ended—
3338,269,what could it hinder so—to say?
3339,269,tell him—just how she sealed you—cautious!
3340,269,but—if he ask where you are hid
3341,269,until tomorrow—happy letter!
3342,269,gesture coquette—and shake your head!
3343,270,good morning—midnight—
3344,270,i'm coming home—
3345,270,day—got tired of me—
3346,270,how could i—of him?
3347,270,sunshine was a sweet place—
3348,270,i liked to stay—
3349,270,but morn—didn't want me—now—
3350,270,so—goodnight—day!
3351,270,i can look—can't i—
3352,270,when the east is red?
3353,270,the hills—have a way—then—
3354,270,that puts the heart—abroad—
3355,270,you—are not so fair—midnight—
3356,270,i chose—day—
3357,270,but—please take a little girl—
3358,270,he turned away!
3359,271,good night! which put the candle out?
3360,271,"a jealous zephyr, not a doubt."
3361,271,"  ah! friend, you little knew"
3362,271,how long at that celestial wick
3363,271,the angels labored diligent;
3364,271,"  extinguished, now, for you!"
3365,271,it might have been the lighthouse spark
3366,271,"some sailor, rowing in the dark,"
3367,271,  had importuned to see!
3368,271,it might have been the waning lamp
3369,271,that lit the drummer from the camp
3370,271,  to purer reveille!
3371,272,"good night, because we must,"
3372,272,how intricate the dust!
3373,272,"i would go, to know!"
3374,272,oh incognito!
3375,272,"saucy, saucy seraph"
3376,272,to elude me so!
3377,272,"father! they won't tell me,"
3378,272,won't you tell them to?
3379,273,"good to hide, and hear 'em hunt!"
3380,273,"better, to be found,"
3381,273,"if one care to, that is,"
3382,273,the fox fits the hound—
3383,273,"good to know, and not tell,"
3384,273,"best, to know and tell,"
3385,273,can one find the rare ear
3386,273,not too dull—
3387,274,gratitude—is not the mention
3388,274,"of a tenderness,"
3389,274,but its still appreciation
3390,274,out of plumb of speech.
3391,274,when the sea return no answer
3392,274,by the line and lead
3393,274,"proves it there's no sea, or rather"
3394,274,a remoter bed?
3395,275,great caesar! condescend
3396,275,"the daisy, to receive,"
3397,275,"gathered by cato's daughter,"
3398,275,with your majestic leave!
3399,276,grief is a mouse—
3400,276,and chooses wainscot in the breast
3401,276,for his shy house—
3402,276,and baffles quest—
3403,276,grief is a thief—quick startled—
3404,276,pricks his ear—report to hear
3405,276,of that vast dark—
3406,276,that swept his being—back—
3407,276,grief is a juggler—boldest at the play—
3408,276,lest if he flinch—the eye that way
3409,276,pounce on his bruises—one—say—or three—
3410,276,grief is a gourmand—spare his luxury—
3411,276,best grief is tongueless—before he'll tell—
3412,276,burn him in the public square—
3413,276,his ashes—will
3414,276,possibly—if they refuse—how then know—
3415,276,since a rack couldn't coax a syllable—now.
3416,277,growth of man—like growth of nature—
3417,277,gravitates within—
3418,277,"atmosphere, and sun endorse it—"
3419,277,bit it stir—alone—
3420,277,each—its difficult ideal
3421,277,must achieve—itself—
3422,277,through the solitary prowess
3423,277,of a silent life—
3424,277,effort—is the sole condition—
3425,277,patience of itself—
3426,277,patience of opposing forces—
3427,277,and intact belief—
3428,277,looking on—is the department
3429,277,of its audience—
3430,277,but transaction—is assisted
3431,277,by no countenance—
3432,278,"had i not this, or this, i said,"
3433,278,"appealing to myself,"
3434,278,in moment of prosperity—
3435,278,inadequate—were life—
3436,278,"""thou hast not me, nor me""—it said,"
3437,278,in moment of reverse—
3438,278,"""and yet thou art industrious—"
3439,278,"no need—hadst thou—of us""?"
3440,278,my need—was all i had—i said—
3441,278,the need did not reduce—
3442,278,because the food—exterminate—
3443,278,the hunger—does not cease—
3444,278,but diligence—is sharper—
3445,278,proportioned to the chance—
3446,278,to feed upon the retrograde—
3447,278,enfeebles—the advance—
3448,279,had i presumed to hope—
3449,279,the loss had been to me
3450,279,a value—for the greatness' sake—
3451,279,as giants—gone away—
3452,279,had i presumed to gain
3453,279,a favor so remote—
3454,279,the failure but confirm the grace
3455,279,in further infinite—
3456,279,'tis failure—not of hope—
3457,279,but confident despair—
3458,279,advancing on celestial lists—
3459,279,with faint—terrestial power—
3460,279,'tis honor—though i die—
3461,279,for that no man obtain
3462,279,till he be justified by death—
3463,279,this—is the second gain—
3464,280,have any like myself
3465,280,"investigating march,"
3466,280,new houses on the hill descried—
3467,280,and possibly a church—
3468,280,"that were not, we are sure—"
3469,280,as lately as the snow—
3470,280,and are today—if we exist—
3471,280,though how may this be so?
3472,280,have any like myself
3473,280,conjectured who may be
3474,280,the occupants of the adobes—
3475,280,so easy to the sky—
3476,280,'twould seem that god should be
3477,280,the nearest neighbor to—
3478,280,and heaven—a convenient grace
3479,280,"for show, or company—"
3480,280,have any like myself
3481,280,preserved the charm secure
3482,280,by shunning carefully the place
3483,280,"all seasons of the year,"
3484,280,excepting march—'tis then
3485,280,my villages be seen—
3486,280,and possibly a steeple—
3487,280,not afterward—by men—
3488,281,"have you got a brook in your little heart,"
3489,281,"where bashful flowers blow,"
3490,281,"and blushing birds go down to drink,"
3491,281,and shadows tremble so—
3492,281,"and nobody knows, so still it flows,"
3493,281,"that any brook is there,"
3494,281,and yet your little draught of life
3495,281,is daily drunken there—
3496,281,"why, look out for the little brook in march,"
3497,281,"when the rivers overflow,"
3498,281,"and the snows come hurrying from the fills,"
3499,281,and the bridges often go—
3500,281,"and later, in august it may be—"
3501,281,"when the meadows parching lie,"
3502,281,"beware, lest this little brook of life,"
3503,281,some burning noon go dry!
3504,282,he forgot—and i—remembered—
3505,282,'twas an everyday affair—
3506,282,long ago as christ and peter—
3507,282,"""warmed them"" at the ""temple fire."""
3508,282,"""thou wert with him""—quoth ""the damsel""?"
3509,282,"""no""—said peter, 'twasn't me—"
3510,282,"jesus merely ""looked"" at peter—"
3511,282,could i do aught else—to thee?
3512,283,he fought like those who've nought to lose—
3513,283,bestowed himself to balls
3514,283,as one who for a further life
3515,283,had not a further use—
3516,283,invited death—with bold attempt—
3517,283,but death was coy of him
3518,283,"as other men, were coy of death—"
3519,283,to him—to live—was doom—
3520,283,"his comrades, shifted like the flakes"
3521,283,when gusts reverse the snow—
3522,283,but he—was left alive because
3523,283,of greediness to die—
3524,284,he found my being—set it up—
3525,284,adjusted it to place—
3526,284,then carved his name—upon it—
3527,284,and bade it to the east
3528,284,be faithful—in his absence—
3529,284,and he would come again—
3530,284,with equipage of amber—
3531,284,that time—to take it home—
3532,285,he fumbles at your spirit
3533,285,  as players at the keys
3534,285,before they drop full music on;
3535,285,"  he stuns you by degrees,"
3536,285,prepares your brittle substance
3537,285,"  for the ethereal blow,"
3538,285,"by fainter hammers, further heard,"
3539,285,"  then nearer, then so slow"
3540,285,"your breath has time to straighten,"
3541,285,"  your brain to bubble cool,  "
3542,285,deals one imperial thunderbolt
3543,285,  that scalps your naked soul.
3544,286,he gave away his life—
3545,286,to us—gigantic sum—
3546,286,a trifle—in his own esteem—
3547,286,but magnified—by fame—
3548,286,until it burst the hearts
3549,286,that fancied they could hold—
3550,286,when swift it slipped its limit—
3551,286,and on the heavens—unrolled—
3552,286,'tis ours—to wince—and weep—
3553,286,and wonder—and decay
3554,286,by blossoms gradual process—
3555,286,he chose—maturity—
3556,286,and quickening—as we sowed—
3557,286,just obviated bud—
3558,286,and when we turned to note the growth—
3559,286,broke—perfect—from the pod—
3560,287,"he outstripped time with but a bout,"
3561,287,he outstripped stars and sun
3562,287,"and then, unjaded, challenged god"
3563,287,in presence of the throne.
3564,287,and he and he in mighty list
3565,287,"unto this present, run,"
3566,287,the larger glory for the less
3567,287,a just sufficient ring.
3568,288,he parts himself—like leaves—
3569,288,and then—he closes up—
3570,288,then stands upon the bonnet
3571,288,of any buttercup—
3572,288,and then he runs against
3573,288,and oversets a rose—
3574,288,and then does nothing—
3575,288,then away upon a jib—he goes—
3576,288,and dangles like a mote
3577,288,suspended in the noon—
3578,288,uncertain—to return below—
3579,288,or settle in the moon—
3580,288,what come of him—at night—
3581,288,the privilege to say
3582,288,be limited by ignorance—
3583,288,what come of him—that day—
3584,288,the frost—possess the world—
3585,288,in cabinets—be shown—
3586,288,a sepulchre of quaintest floss—
3587,288,an abbey—a cocoon—
3588,289,he put the belt around my life
3589,289,i heard the buckle snap—
3590,289,"and turned away, imperial,"
3591,289,my lifetime folding up—
3592,289,"deliberate, as a duke would do"
3593,289,a kingdom's title deed—
3594,289,"henceforth, a dedicated sort—"
3595,289,a member of the cloud.
3596,289,yet not too far to come at call—
3597,289,and do the little toils
3598,289,that make the circuit of the rest—
3599,289,and deal occasional smiles
3600,289,to lives that stoop to notice mine—
3601,289,and kindly ask it in—
3602,289,"whose invitation, know you not"
3603,289,for whom i must decline?
3604,290,he strained my faith—
3605,290,did he find it supple?
3606,290,shook my strong trust—
3607,290,did it then—yield?
3608,290,hurled my belief—
3609,290,but—did he shatter—it?
3610,290,racked—with suspense—
3611,290,not a nerve failed!
3612,290,wrung me—with anguish—
3613,290,but i never doubted him—
3614,290,'tho' for what wrong
3615,290,he did never say—
3616,290,stabbed—while i sued
3617,290,his sweet forgiveness—
3618,290,"jesus—it's your little ""john""!"
3619,290,don't you know—me?
3620,291,he told a homely tale
3621,291,and spotted it with tears—
3622,291,upon his infant face was set
3623,291,the cicatrice of years—
3624,291,all crumpled was the cheek
3625,291,no other kiss had known
3626,291,"than flake of snow, divided with"
3627,291,the redbreast of the barn—
3628,291,if mother—in the grave—
3629,291,or father—on the sea—
3630,291,or father in the firmament—
3631,291,"or brethren, had he—"
3632,291,"if commonwealth below,"
3633,291,or commonwealth above
3634,291,have missed a barefoot citizen—
3635,291,i've ransomed it—alive—
3636,292,"he touched me, so i live to know"
3637,292,"that such a day, permitted so,"
3638,292,i groped upon his breast—
3639,292,it was a boundless place to me
3640,292,"and silenced, as the awful sea"
3641,292,puts minor streams to rest.
3642,292,"and now, i'm different from before,"
3643,292,as if i breathed superior air—
3644,292,or brushed a royal gown—
3645,292,"my feet, too, that had wandered so—"
3646,292,my gypsy face—transfigured now—
3647,292,to tenderer renown—
3648,292,"into this port, if i might come,"
3649,292,"rebecca, to jerusalem,"
3650,292,would not so ravished turn—
3651,292,"nor persian, baffled at her shrine"
3652,292,lift such a crucifixial sign
3653,292,to her imperial sun.
3654,293,"he was weak, and i was strong—then—"
3655,293,so he let me lead him in—
3656,293,"i was weak, and he was strong then—"
3657,293,so i let him lead me—home.
3658,293,'twasn't far—the door was near—
3659,293,'twasn't dark—for he went—too—
3660,293,"'twasn't loud, for he said nought—"
3661,293,that was all i cared to know.
3662,293,day knocked—and we must part—
3663,293,neither—was strongest—now—
3664,293,he strove—and i strove—too—
3665,293,we didn't do it—tho'!
3666,294,he who in himself believes—
3667,294,fraud cannot presume—
3668,294,faith is constancy's result—
3669,294,and assumes—from home—
3670,294,"cannot perish, though it fail"
3671,294,every second time—
3672,294,but defaced vicariously—
3673,294,for some other shame—
3674,295,"heart, not so heavy as mine"
3675,295,wending late home—
3676,295,as it passed my window
3677,295,whistled itself a tune—
3678,295,a careless snatch—a ballad—a ditty of the street—
3679,295,yet to my irritated ear
3680,295,an anodyne so sweet—
3681,295,it was as if a bobolink
3682,295,sauntering this way
3683,295,"carolled, and paused, and carolled—"
3684,295,then bubbled slow away!
3685,295,it was as if a chirping brook
3686,295,upon a dusty way—
3687,295,set bleeding feet to minuets
3688,295,without the knowing why!
3689,295,"tomorrow, night will come again—"
3690,295,"perhaps, weary and sore—"
3691,295,ah bugle! by my window
3692,295,i pray you pass once more.
3693,296,"heart, we will forget him,"
3694,296,"you and i, tonight!"
3695,296,"you must forget the warmth he gave,"
3696,296,i will forget the light.
3697,296,"when you have done pray tell me,"
3698,296,"then i, my thoughts, will dim."
3699,296,haste! ‘lest while you’re lagging
3700,296,i may remember him!

3704,297,"and when again, at dawn,"
3705,297,a mighty look runs round the world
3706,297,and settles in the hills—
3707,297,an awe if it should be like that

3710,297,the triumph of the birds

3775,302,sweet of twigs and twine
3776,302,my perennial nest.
3777,303,her final summer was it—

3781,303,a further force of life
3782,303,developed from within—
3783,303,when death lit all the shortness up
3784,303,it made the hurry plain—
3785,303,we wondered at our blindness
3786,303,when nothing was to see
3787,303,but her carrara guide post—
3788,303,at our stupidity—
3789,303,when duller than our dullness
3790,303,the busy darling lay—
3791,303,so busy was she—finishing—

3804,305,like beads—among the bog—
3805,306,her sweet turn to leave the homestead
3806,306,came the darker way—

3808,306,but for holiday
3809,306,'tis more pitiful endeavor

3834,307,had scarcely deigned to lie—
3835,307,"when, stirring, for belief's delight,"
3836,307,my bride had slipped away—
3837,307,if 'twas a dream—made solid—just
3838,307,the heaven to confirm—
3839,307,or if myself were dreamed of her—
3840,307,the power to presume—
3841,307,with him remain—who unto me—
3842,307,gave—even as to all—
3843,307,a fiction superseding faith—
3844,307,by so much—as 'twas real—
3845,308,"her—""last poems""—"

3850,308,so divine—

3852,308,robin—uttered half the tune—
3853,308,gushed too free for the adoring—
3854,308,from the anglo-florentine—
3855,308,late—the praise—
3856,308,'tis dull—conferring
3857,308,on the head too high to crown—

3860,308,nought—that we—no poet's kinsman—

3871,310,"a worm, his utmost goal."
3872,311,his feet are shod with gauze—
3873,311,"his helmet, is of gold,"
3874,311,"his breast, a single onyx"
3875,311,"with chrysophrase, inlaid."
3876,311,his labor is a chant—
3877,311,his idleness—a tune—
3878,311,"oh, for a bee's experience"
3879,311,"of clovers, and of noon!"
3880,312,"years i had been from home,"
3881,312,"and now, before the door"
3882,312,"i dared not open, lest a face"
3883,312,i never saw before
3884,312,stare vacant into mine
3885,312,and ask my business there.
3886,312,"my business, - just a life i left,"
3887,312,was such still dwelling there?
3888,312,"i fumbled at my nerve,"
3889,312,i scanned the windows near;
3890,312,"the silence like an ocean rolled,"
3891,312,and broke against my ear.
3892,312,i laughed a wooden laugh
3893,312,"that i could fear a door,"
3894,312,"who danger and the dead had faced,"
3895,312,but never quaked before.
3896,312,i fitted to the latch
3897,312,"my hand, with trembling care,"
3898,312,"lest back the awful door should spring,"
3899,312,and leave me standing there.
3900,312,i moved my fingers off
3901,312,"as cautiously as glass,"
3902,312,"and held my ears, and like a thief"
3903,312,fled gasping from the house.
3904,313,"""hope"" is the thing with feathers—"
3905,313,that perches in the soul—
3906,313,and sings the tune without the words—
3907,313,and never stops—at all—
3908,313,and sweetest—in the gale—is heard—
3909,313,and sore must be the storm—
3910,313,that could abash the little bird
3911,313,that kept so many warm—
3912,313,i've heard it in the chillest land—
3913,313,and on the strangest sea—
3914,313,"yet, never, in extremity,"

3924,315,how far is it to heaven?
3925,315,as far as death this way—
3926,315,of river or of ridge beyond
3927,315,was no discovery.
3928,315,how far is it to hell?
3929,315,as far as death this way—
3930,315,how far left hand the sepulchre
3931,315,defies topography.
3932,316,how fortunate the grave—
3933,316,all prizes to obtain—
3934,316,"successful certain, if at last,"
3935,316,first suitor not in vain.
3936,317,how happy i was if i could forget
3937,317,to remember how sad i am
3938,317,would be an easy adversity
3939,317,but the recollecting of bloom
3940,317,keeps making november difficult
3941,317,till i who was almost bold
3942,317,lose my way like a little child
3943,317,and perish of the cold.
3944,318,how happy is the little stone
3945,318,"that rambles in the road alone,"
3946,318,and doesn't care about careers
3947,318,and exigencies never fears—
3948,318,whose coat of elemental brown
3949,318,"a passing universe put on,"
3950,318,and independent as the sun
3951,318,"associates or glows alone,"
3952,318,fulfilling absolute decree
3953,318,in casual simplicity—
3954,319,how many flowers fail in wood—
3955,319,or perish from the hill—
3956,319,without the privilege to know
3957,319,that they are beautiful—
3958,319,how many cast a nameless pod
3959,319,upon the nearest breeze—
3960,319,unconscious of the scarlet freight—
3961,319,it bear to other eyes—
3962,320,how many times these low feet staggered—
3963,320,only the soldered mouth can tell—
3964,320,try—can you stir the awful rivet—
3965,320,try—can you lift the hasps of steel!
3966,320,stroke the cool forehead—hot so often—
3967,320,lift—if you care—the listless hair—
3968,320,handle the adamantine fingers
3969,320,never a thimble—more—shall wear—
3970,320,buzz the dull flies—on the chamber window—
3971,320,brave—shines the sun through the freckled pane—
3972,320,fearless—the cobweb swings from the ceiling—
3973,320,indolent housewife—in daisies—lain!

3975,321,until a sudden sky
3976,321,reveals the fact that one is rapt
3977,321,forever from the eye—
3978,321,"members of the invisible,"
3979,321,"existing, while we stare,"
3980,321,"in leagueless opportunity,"

3983,321,"the heavens with a smile,"
3984,321,sweep by our disappointed heads
3985,321,without a syllable—
3986,322,how sick—to wait—in any place—but thine—
3987,322,i knew last night—when someone tried to twine—
3988,322,thinking—perhaps—that i looked tired—or alone—
3989,322,or breaking—almost—with unspoken pain—

3999,323,how the hemlocks burn—
4000,323,how the dun brake is draped in cinder
4001,323,by the wizard sun—
4002,323,how the old steeples hand the scarlet
4003,323,till the ball is full—
4004,323,have i the lip of the flamingo
4005,323,that i dare to tell?
4006,323,"then, how the fire ebbs like billows—"
4007,323,touching all the grass
4008,323,with a departing—sapphire—feature—
4009,323,as a duchess passed—
4010,323,how a small dusk crawls on the village
4011,323,till the houses blot
4012,323,"and the odd flambeau, no men carry"
4013,323,glimmer on the street—
4014,323,how it is night—in nest and kennel—
4015,323,and where was the wood—
4016,323,just a dome of abyss is bowing
4017,323,into solitude—
4018,323,these are the visions flitted guido—
4019,323,titian—never told—
4020,323,domenichino dropped his pencil—
4021,323,"paralyzed, with gold—"
4022,324,how the waters closed above him
4023,324,we shall never know—
4024,324,how he stretched his anguish to us
4025,324,that—is covered too—
4026,324,spreads the pond her base of lilies
4027,324,bold above the boy
4028,324,whose unclaimed hat and jacket
4029,324,sum the history—
4030,325,how well i knew her not
4031,325,whom not to know has been
4032,325,"a bounty in prospective, now"
4033,325,next door to mine the pain.
4034,326,i am alive—i guess—
4035,326,the branches on my hand
4036,326,are full of morning glory—
4037,326,and at my finger's end—
4038,326,the carmine—tingles warm—
4039,326,and if i hold a glass
4040,326,across my mouth—it blurs it—
4041,326,physician's—proof of breath—
4042,326,i am alive—because
4043,326,i am not in a room—
4044,326,the parlor—commonly—it is—

4046,326,and lean—and view it sidewise—

4048,326,"and ""was it conscious—when it stepped"
4049,326,"in immortality?"""
4050,326,i am alive—because
4051,326,i do not own a house—
4052,326,entitled to myself—precise—
4053,326,and fitting no one else—
4054,326,and marked my girlhood's name—
4055,326,so visitors may know
4056,326,which door is mine—and not
4057,327,i am ashamed—i hide—
4058,327,what right have i—to be a bride—
4059,327,so late a dowerless girl—
4060,327,nowhere to hide my dazzled face—
4061,327,no one to teach me that new grace—
4062,327,nor introduce—my soul—
4063,327,me to adorn—how—tell—
4064,327,trinket—to make me beautiful—
4065,327,fabrics of cashmere—
4066,327,never a gown of dun—more—
4067,327,raiment instead—of pompadour—
4068,327,for me—my soul—to wear—
4069,327,fingers—to frame my round hair
4070,327,oval—as feudal ladies wore—
4071,327,far fashions—fair—
4072,327,skill to hold my brow like an earl—
4073,327,plead—like a whippoorwill—

4081,327,no more to hide—
4082,327,meek—let it be—too proud—for pride—
4083,327,baptized—this day—a bride—
4084,328,i asked no other thing—
4085,328,no other—was denied—
4086,328,i offered being—for it—
4087,328,the mighty merchant sneered—
4088,328,brazil? he twirled a button—
4089,328,without a glance my way—
4090,328,"""but—madam—is there nothing else—"
4091,328,"that we can show—today?"""
4092,329,i breathed enough to take the trick—
4093,329,"and now, removed from air—"
4094,329,"i simulate the breath, so well—"
4095,329,"that one, to be quite sure—"
4096,329,the lungs are stirless—must descend
4097,329,among the cunning cells—
4098,329,"and touch the pantomine—himself,"
4099,329,"how numb, the bellows feels!"
4100,330,i bring an unaccustomed wine
4101,330,to lips long parching
4102,330,"next to mine,"
4103,330,and summon them to drink;
4104,330,"crackling with fever, they essay,"
4105,330,"i turn my brimming eyes away,"
4106,330,and come next hour to look.
4107,330,the hands still hug the tardy glass—
4108,330,"the lips i would have cooled, alas—"
4109,330,are so superfluous cold—
4110,330,i would as soon attempt to warm
4111,330,the bosoms where the frost has lain
4112,330,ages beneath the mould—
4113,330,some other thirsty there may be
4114,330,to whom this would have pointed me
4115,330,had it remained to speak—
4116,330,and so i always bear the cup
4117,330,"if, haply, mine may be the drop"
4118,330,some pilgrim thirst to slake—
4119,330,"if, haply, any say to me"
4120,330,"""unto the little, unto me,"""
4121,330,when i at last awake.
4122,331,i came to buy a smile—today—
4123,331,but just a single smile—
4124,331,the smallest one upon your face
4125,331,will suit me just as well—
4126,331,the one that no one else would miss
4127,331,it shone so very small—
4128,331,"i'm pleading at the ""counter""—sir—"
4129,331,could you afford to sell—
4130,331,i've diamonds—on my fingers—
4131,331,you know what diamonds are?
4132,331,i've rubies—live the evening blood—
4133,331,and topaz—like the star!
4134,331,"'twould be ""a bargain"" for a jew!"
4135,331,say—may i have it—sir?
4136,332,i can wade grief—
4137,332,whole pools of it—
4138,332,i'm used to that—
4139,332,but the least push of joy
4140,332,breaks up my feet—
4141,332,and i tip—drunken—
4142,332,let no pebble—smile—
4143,332,'twas the new liquor—
4144,332,that was all!
4145,332,power is only pain—
4146,332,"stranded, thro' discipline,"
4147,332,till weights—will hang—
4148,332,give balm—to giants—
4149,332,"and they'll wilt, like men—"
4150,332,give himmaleh—
4151,332,they'll carry—him!
4152,333,i can't tell you—but you feel it—
4153,333,nor can you tell me—
4154,333,"saints, with ravished slate and pencil"
4155,333,solve our april day!
4156,333,sweeter than a vanished frolic
4157,333,from a vanished green!
4158,333,swifter than the hoofs of horsemen
4159,333,round a ledge of dream!
4160,333,"modest, let us walk among it"
4161,333,with our faces veiled—
4162,333,as they say polite archangels
4163,333,do in meeting god!
4164,333,not for me—to prate about it!
4165,333,not for you—to say
4166,333,to some fashionable lady
4167,333,"""charming april day""!"
4168,333,"rather—heaven's ""peter parley""!"
4169,333,by which children slow
4170,333,to sublimer recitation
4171,333,are prepared to go!
4172,334,i cannot be ashamed
4173,334,because i cannot see
4174,334,the love you offer—
4175,334,magnitude
4176,334,reverses modesty
4177,334,and i cannot be proud
4178,334,because a height so high
4179,334,involves alpine
4180,334,requirements
4181,334,and services of snow.
4182,335,i cannot buy it—'tis not sold—
4183,335,there is no other in the world—
4184,335,mine was the only one
4185,335,i was so happy i forgot
4186,335,to shut the door and it went out
4187,335,and i am all alone—
4188,335,if i could find it anywhere
4189,335,i would not mind the journey there
4190,335,though it took all my store
4191,335,but just to look it in the eye—
4192,335,"""did'st thou?"" ""thou did'st not mean,"" to say,"
4193,335,"then, turn my face away."
4194,336,i cannot dance upon my toes—
4195,336,no man instructed me—
4196,336,"but oftentimes, among my mind,"
4197,336,"a glee possesseth me,"
4198,336,that had i ballet knowledge—
4199,336,would put itself abroad
4200,336,in pirouette to blanch a troupe—
4201,336,"or lay a prima, mad,"
4202,336,and though i had no gown of gauze—
4203,336,"no ringlet, to my hair,"
4204,336,"nor hopped to audiences—like birds,"
4205,336,"one claw upon the air,"
4206,336,"nor tossed my shape in eider balls,"
4207,336,nor rolled on wheels of snow
4208,336,"till i was out of sight, in sound,"
4209,336,the house encore me so—
4210,336,nor any know i know the art
4211,336,i mention—easy—here—
4212,336,nor any placard boast me—
4213,336,it's full as opera—
4214,337,i cannot live with you  
4215,337,it would be life  
4216,337,and life is over there  
4217,337,behind the shelf
4218,337,the sexton keeps the key to  
4219,337,putting up
4220,337,our life   his porcelain  
4221,337,like a cup  
4222,337,discarded of the housewife  
4223,337,quaint   or broke  
4224,337,a newer sevres pleases  
4225,337,old ones crack  
4226,337,i could not die   with you  
4227,337,for one must wait
4228,337,to shut the other's gaze down  
4229,337,you   could not  
4230,337,and i   could i stand by
4231,337,and see you   freeze  
4232,337,without my right of frost  
4233,337,death's privilege?
4234,337,nor could i rise   with you  
4235,337,because your face
4236,337,would put out jesus'  
4237,337,that new grace
4238,337,glow plain   and foreign
4239,337,on my homesick eye  
4240,337,except that you than he
4241,337,shone closer by  
4242,337,they'd judge us   how  
4243,337,"for you   served heaven   you know,"
4244,337,or sought to  
4245,337,i could not  
4246,337,because you saturated sight  
4247,337,and i had no more eyes
4248,337,for sordid excellence
4249,337,as paradise
4250,337,"and were you lost, i would be  "
4251,337,though my name
4252,337,rang loudest
4253,337,on the heavenly fame  
4254,337,and were you   saved  
4255,337,and i   condemned to be
4256,337,where you were not  
4257,337,that self   were hell to me  
4258,337,so we must meet apart  
4259,337,you there   i   here  
4260,337,with just the door ajar
4261,337,that oceans are   and prayer  
4262,337,and that white sustenance  
4263,337,despair  
4264,338,"i cautious, scanned my little life—"
4265,338,i winnowed what would fade
4266,338,from what would last till heads like mine
4267,338,should be a-dreaming laid.
4268,338,i put the latter in a barn—
4269,338,"the former, blew away."
4270,338,i went one winter morning
4271,338,and lo - my priceless hay
4272,338,"was not upon the ""scaffold""—"
4273,338,"was not upon the ""beam""—"
4274,338,and from a thriving farmer—
4275,338,"a cynic, i became."
4276,338,whether a thief did it—
4277,338,whether it was the wind—
4278,338,whether deity's guiltless—
4279,338,"my business is, to find!"
4280,338,so i begin to ransack!
4281,338,"how is it hearts, with thee?"
4282,338,art thou within the little barn
4283,338,love provided thee?
4284,339,i could bring you jewels—had i a mind to—
4285,339,but you have enough—of those—
4286,339,i could bring you odors from st. domingo—
4287,339,colors—from vera cruz—
4288,339,berries of the bahamas—have i—
4289,339,but this little blaze
4290,339,flickering to itself—in the meadow—
4291,339,suits me—more than those—
4292,339,never a fellow matched this topaz—
4293,339,and his emerald swing—
4294,339,dower itself—for bobadilo—
4295,339,better—could i bring?
4296,340,i could die—to know—
4297,340,'tis a trifling knowledge—
4298,340,news-boys salute the door—
4299,340,carts—joggle by—
4300,340,morning's bold face—stares in the window—
4301,340,were but mine—the charter of the least fly—
4302,340,houses hunch the house
4303,340,with their brick shoulders—
4304,340,coals—from a rolling load—rattle—how—near—
4305,340,to the very square—his foot is passing—
4306,340,"possibly, this moment—"
4307,340,while i—dream—here—
4308,341,"i could not drink it, sweet,"
4309,341,"till you had tasted first,"
4310,341,though cooler than the water was
4311,341,the thoughtfulness of thirst.
4312,342,i could not prove the years had feet—
4313,342,yet confident they run
4314,342,"am i, from symptoms that are past"
4315,342,and series that are done—
4316,342,i find my feet have further goals—
4317,342,i smile upon the aims
4318,342,that felt so ample—yesterday—
4319,342,today's—have vaster claims—
4320,342,i do not doubt the self i was
4321,342,was competent to me—
4322,342,but something awkward in the fit—
4323,342,proves that—outgrown—i see—
4324,343,"i could suffice for him, i knew—"
4325,343,he—could suffice for me—
4326,343,yet hesitating fractions—both
4327,343,surveyed infinity—
4328,343,"""would i be whole"" he sudden broached—"
4329,343,my syllable rebelled—
4330,343,'twas face to face with nature—forced—
4331,343,'twas face to face with god—
4332,343,withdrew the sun—to other wests—
4333,343,withdrew the furthest star
4334,343,before decision—stooped to speech—
4335,343,and then—be audibler
4336,343,the answer of the sea unto
4337,343,the motion of the moon—
4338,343,herself adjust her tides—unto—
4339,343,could i—do else—with mine?
4340,344,i cried at pity—not at pain—
4341,344,i heard a woman say
4342,344,"""poor child""—and something in her voice"
4343,344,convicted me—of me—
4344,344,"so long i fainted, to myself"
4345,344,"it seemed the common way,"
4346,344,"and health, and laughter, curious things—"
4347,344,"to look at, like a toy—"
4348,344,"to sometimes hear ""rich people"" buy"
4349,344,and see the parcel rolled—
4350,344,"and carried, i supposed—to heaven,"
4351,344,"for children, made of gold—"
4352,344,"but not to touch, or wish for,"
4353,344,"or think of, with a sigh—"
4354,344,"and so and so—had been to me,"
4355,344,had god willed differently.
4356,344,i wish i knew that woman's name—
4357,344,"so when she comes this way,"
4358,344,"to hold my life, and hold my ears"
4359,344,for fear i hear her say
4360,344,"she's ""sorry i am dead""—again—"
4361,344,just when the grave and i—
4362,344,"have sobbed ourselves almost to sleep,"
4363,344,our only lullaby—
4364,345,i cross till i am weary
4365,345,a mountain—in my mind—
4366,345,more mountains—then a sea—
4367,345,more seas—and then
4368,345,a desert—find—
4369,345,and my horizon blocks
4370,345,with steady—drifting—grains
4371,345,of unconjectured quantity—
4372,345,as asiatic rains—
4373,345,nor this—defeat my pace—
4374,345,it hinder from the west
4375,345,but as an enemy's salute
4376,345,one hurrying to rest—
4377,345,what merit had the goal—
4378,345,except there intervene
4379,345,faint doubt—and far competitor—
4380,345,to jeopardize the gain?
4381,345,at last—the grace in sight—
4382,345,i shout unto my feet—
4383,345,i offer them the whole of heaven
4384,345,the instant that we meet—
4385,345,they strive—and yet delay—
4386,345,they perish—do we die—
4387,345,or is this death's experiment—
4388,345,reversed—in victory?
4389,346,i died for beauty—but was scarce
4390,346,adjusted in the tomb
4391,346,"when one who died for truth, was lain"
4392,346,in an adjoining room—
4393,346,"he questioned softly ""why i failed""?"
4394,346,"""for beauty"", i replied—"
4395,346,"""and i—for truth—themself are one—"
4396,346,"we brethren, are"", he said—"
4397,346,"and so, as kinsmen, met a night—"
4398,346,we talked between the rooms—
4399,346,until the moss had reached our lips—
4400,346,and covered up—our names—
4401,347,"i dreaded that first robin, so,"
4402,347,"but he is mastered, now,"
4403,347,"i'm accustomed to him grown,"
4404,347,"he hurts a little, though—"
4405,347,i thought if i could only live
4406,347,till that first shout got by—
4407,347,not all pianos in the woods
4408,347,had power to mangle me—
4409,347,i dared not meet the daffodils—
4410,347,for fear their yellow gown
4411,347,would pierce me with a fashion
4412,347,so foreign to my own—
4413,347,i wished the grass would hurry—
4414,347,so—when 'twas time to see—
4415,347,"he'd be too tall, the tallest one"
4416,347,could stretch—to look at me—
4417,347,"i could not bear the bees should come,"
4418,347,i wished they'd stay away
4419,347,"in those dim countries where they go,"
4420,347,"what word had they, for me?"
4421,347,"they're here, though; not a creature failed—"
4422,347,no blossom stayed away
4423,347,in gentle deference to me—
4424,347,the queen of calvary—
4425,347,"each one salutes me, as he goes,"
4426,347,"and i, my childish plumes,"
4427,347,"lift, in bereaved acknowledgment"
4428,347,of their unthinking drums—
4429,348,i dwell in possibility—
4430,348,a fairer house than prose—
4431,348,more numerous of windows—
4432,348,superior—for doors—
4433,348,of chambers as the cedars—
4434,348,impregnable of eye—
4435,348,and for an everlasting roof
4436,348,the gambrels of the sky—
4437,348,of visitors—the fairest—
4438,348,for occupation—this—
4439,348,the spreading wide of narrow hands
4440,348,to gather paradise—
4441,349,"i envy seas, whereon he rides—"
4442,349,i envy spokes of wheels
4443,349,"of chariots, that him convey—"
4444,349,i envy crooked hills
4445,349,that gaze upon his journey—
4446,349,how easy all can see
4447,349,what is forbidden utterly
4448,349,as heaven—unto me!
4449,349,i envy nests of sparrows—
4450,349,that dot his distant eaves—
4451,349,"the wealthy fly, upon his pane—"
4452,349,the happy—happy leaves—
4453,349,that just abroad his window
4454,349,have summer's leave to play—
4455,349,the ear rings of pizarro
4456,349,could not obtain for me—
4457,349,i envy light—that wakes him—
4458,349,and bells—that boldly ring
4459,349,"to tell him it is noon, abroad—"
4460,349,myself—be noon to him—
4461,349,yet interdict—my blossom—
4462,349,and abrogate—my bee—
4463,349,lest noon in everlasting night—
4464,349,drop gabriel—and me—
4465,350,i fear a man of frugal speech—
4466,350,i fear a silent man—
4467,350,haranguer—i can overtake—
4468,350,or babbler—entertain—
4469,350,but he who weigheth—while the rest—
4470,350,expend their furthest pound—
4471,350,of this man—i am wary—
4472,350,i fear that he is grand—
4473,351,i felt a cleaving in my mind
4474,351,  as if my brain had split;
4475,351,"i tried to match it, seam by seam,"
4476,351,  but could not make them fit.
4477,351,the thought behind i strove to join
4478,351,"  unto the thought before,"
4479,351,but sequence ravelled out of reach
4480,351,  like balls upon a floor.
4481,352,"i felt a funeral, in my brain,"
4482,352,and mourners to and fro
4483,352,kept treading—treading—till it seemed
4484,352,that sense was breaking through—
4485,352,"and when they all were seated,"
4486,352,"a service, like a drum—"
4487,352,kept beating—beating—till i thought
4488,352,my mind was going numb—
4489,352,and then i heard them lift a box
4490,352,and creak across my soul
4491,352,"with those same boots of lead, again,"
4492,352,"then space—began to toll,"
4493,352,"as all the heavens were a bell,"
4494,352,"and being, but an ear,"
4495,352,"and i, and silence, some strange race"
4496,352,"wrecked, solitary, here—"
4497,352,"and then a plank in reason, broke,"
4498,352,"and i dropped down, and down—"
4499,352,"and hit a world, at every plunge,"
4500,352,and finished knowing—then—
4501,353,i felt my life with both my hands
4502,353,to see if it was there—
4503,353,"i held my spirit to the glass,"
4504,353,to prove it possibler—
4505,353,i turned my being round and round
4506,353,and paused at every pound
4507,353,to ask the owner's name—
4508,353,"for doubt, that i should know the sound—"
4509,353,i judged my features—jarred my hair—
4510,353,"i pushed my dimples by, and waited—"
4511,353,if they—twinkled back—
4512,353,"conviction might, of me—"
4513,353,"i told myself, ""take courage, friend—"
4514,353,that—was a former time—
4515,353,"but we might learn to like the heaven,"
4516,353,"as well as our old home!"""
4517,354,i found the phrase to every thought
4518,354,"i ever had, but one;"
4519,354,"and that defies me, as a hand"
4520,354,did try to chalk the sun
4521,354,to races nurtured in the dark; 
4522,354,how would your own begin?
4523,354,"can blaze be done in cochineal,"
4524,354,or noon in mazarin?
4525,355,i gained it so—
4526,355,by climbing slow—
4527,355,by catching at the twigs that grow
4528,355,between the bliss—and me—
4529,355,it hung so high
4530,355,as well the sky
4531,355,attempt by strategy—
4532,355,i said i gained it—
4533,355,this—was all—
4534,355,"look, how i clutch it"
4535,355,lest it fall—
4536,355,and i a pauper go—
4537,355,unfitted by an instant's grace
4538,355,for the contented—beggar's face
4539,355,i wore—an hour ago—
4540,356,i gave myself to him—
4541,356,"and took himself, for pay,"
4542,356,the solemn contract of a life
4543,356,"was ratified, this way—"
4544,356,the wealth might disappoint—
4545,356,myself a poorer prove
4546,356,"than this great purchaser suspect,"
4547,356,the daily own—of love
4548,356,depreciate the vision—
4549,356,but till the merchant buy—
4550,356,still fable—in the isles of spice—
4551,356,the subtle cargoes—lie—
4552,356,at least—'tis mutual—risk—
4553,356,some—found it—mutual gain—
4554,356,sweet debt of life—each night to owe—
4555,356,insolvent—every noon—
4556,357,i got so i could take his name—
4557,357,without—tremendous gain—
4558,357,that stop-sensation—on my soul—
4559,357,and thunder—in the room—
4560,357,i got so i could walk across
4561,357,"that angle in the floor,"
4562,357,"where he turned so, and i turned—how—"
4563,357,and all our sinew tore—
4564,357,i got so i could stir the box—
4565,357,in which his letters grew
4566,357,"without that forcing, in my breath—"
4567,357,as staples—driven through—
4568,357,could dimly recollect a grace—
4569,357,"i think, they call it ""god""—"
4570,357,renowned to ease extremity—
4571,357,"when formula, had failed—"
4572,357,and shape my hands—
4573,357,"petition's way,"
4574,357,tho' ignorant of a word
4575,357,that ordination—utters—
4576,357,"my business, with the cloud,"
4577,357,"if any power behind it, be,"
4578,357,not subject to despair—
4579,357,"it care, in some remoter way,"
4580,357,for so minute affair
4581,357,as misery—
4582,357,"itself, too vast, for interrupting—more—"
4583,358,i had a guinea golden—
4584,358,i lost it in the sand—
4585,358,and tho' the sum was simple
4586,358,and pounds were in the land—
4587,358,"still, had it such a value"
4588,358,unto my frugal eye—
4589,358,that when i could not find it—
4590,358,i sat me down to sigh.
4591,358,i had a crimson robin—
4592,358,who sang full many a day
4593,358,"but when the woods were painted,"
4594,358,"he, too, did fly away—"
4595,358,time brought me other robins—
4596,358,their ballads were the same—
4597,358,"still, for my missing troubadour"
4598,358,"i kept the ""house at hame."""
4599,358,i had a star in heaven—
4600,358,"one ""pleiad"" was its name—"
4601,358,"and when i was not heeding,"
4602,358,it wandered from the same.
4603,358,and tho' the skies are crowded—
4604,358,and all the night ashine—
4605,358,i do not care about it—
4606,358,since none of them are mine.
4607,358,my story has a moral—
4608,358,i have a missing friend—
4609,358,"""pleiad"" its name, and robin,"
4610,358,and guinea in the sand.
4611,358,and when this mournful ditty
4612,358,accompanied with tear—
4613,358,shall meet the eye of traitor
4614,358,in country far from here—
4615,358,grant that repentance solemn
4616,358,may seize upon his mind—
4617,358,and he no consolation
4618,358,beneath the sun may find.
4619,359,"i had been hungry, all the years—"
4620,359,my noon had come—to dine—
4621,359,i trembling drew the table near—
4622,359,and touched the curious wine—
4623,359,'twas this on tables i had seen—
4624,359,"when turning, hungry, home"
4625,359,"i looked in windows, for the wealth"
4626,359,i could not hope—for mine—
4627,359,i did not know the ample bread—
4628,359,'twas so unlike the crumb
4629,359,"the birds and i, had often shared"
4630,359,in nature's—dining room—
4631,359,the plenty hurt me—'twas so new—
4632,359,myself felt ill—and odd—
4633,359,as berry—of a mountain bush—
4634,359,transplanted—to a road—
4635,359,nor was i hungry—so i found
4636,359,that hunger—was a way
4637,359,of persons outside windows—
4638,359,the entering—takes away—
4639,360,i had no cause to be awake—
4640,360,my best—was gone to sleep—
4641,360,and morn a new politeness took—
4642,360,and failed to wake them up—
4643,360,but called the others—clear—
4644,360,and passed their curtains by—
4645,360,sweet morning—when i oversleep—
4646,360,knock—recollect—to me—
4647,360,i looked at sunrise—once—
4648,360,and then i looked at them—
4649,360,and wishfulness in me arose—
4650,360,for circumstance the same—
4651,360,'twas such an ample peace—
4652,360,it could not hold a sigh—
4653,360,'twas sabbath—with the bells divorced—
4654,360,'twas sunset—all the day—
4655,360,so choosing but a gown—
4656,360,and taking but a prayer—
4657,360,the only raiment i should need—
4658,360,i struggled—and was there—
4659,361,"i had no time to hate, because"
4660,361,"the grave would hinder me,"
4661,361,and life was not so ample i
4662,361,could finish enmity.
4663,361,"nor had i time to love, but since"
4664,361,"some industry must be,"
4665,361,"the little toil of love, i thought,"
4666,361,was large enough for me.
4667,362,i had not minded—walls—
4668,362,were universe—one rock—
4669,362,and fr i heard his silver call
4670,362,the other side the block—
4671,362,i'd tunnel—till my groove
4672,362,pushed sudden thro' to his—
4673,362,then my face take her recompense—
4674,362,the looking in his eyes—
4675,362,but 'tis a single hair—
4676,362,a filament—a law—
4677,362,a cobweb—wove in adamant—
4678,362,a battlement—of straw—
4679,362,a limit like the veil
4680,362,unto the lady's face—
4681,362,but every mesh—a citadel—
4682,362,and dragons—in the crease—
4683,363,i had some things that i called mine—
4684,363,"and god, that he called his,"
4685,363,"till, recently a rival claim"
4686,363,disturbed these amities.
4687,363,"the property, my garden,"
4688,363,"which having sown with care,"
4689,363,"he claims the pretty acre,"
4690,363,and sends a bailiff there.
4691,363,the station of the parties
4692,363,"forbids publicity,"
4693,363,but justice is sublimer
4694,363,"than arms, or pedigree."
4695,363,"i'll institute an ""action""—"
4696,363,i'll vindicate the law—
4697,363,jove! choose your counsel—
4698,363,"i retain ""shaw""!"
4699,364,i had the glory—that will do—
4700,364,"an honor, thought can turn her to"
4701,364,when lesser fames invite—
4702,364,"with one long ""nay""—"
4703,364,bliss' early shape
4704,364,deforming—dwindling—gulfing up—
4705,364,time's possibility.
4706,365,i have a bird in spring
4707,365,which for myself doth sing—
4708,365,the spring decoys.
4709,365,and as the summer nears—
4710,365,"and as the rose appears,"
4711,365,robin is gone.
4712,365,yet do i not repine
4713,365,knowing that bird of mine
4714,365,though flown—
4715,365,learneth beyond the sea
4716,365,melody new for me
4717,365,and will return.
4718,365,fast is a safer hand
4719,365,held in a truer land
4720,365,are mine—
4721,365,"and though they now depart,"
4722,365,tell i my doubting heart
4723,365,they're thine.
4724,365,"in a serener bright,"
4725,365,in a more golden light
4726,365,i see
4727,365,"each little doubt and fear,"
4728,365,each little discord here
4729,365,removed.
4730,365,"then will i not repine,"
4731,365,knowing that bird of mine
4732,365,though flown
4733,365,shall in a distant tree
4734,365,bright melody for me
4735,365,return.
4736,366,"i have a king, who does not speak—"
4737,366,so—wondering—thro' the hours meek
4738,366,i trudge the day away—
4739,366,"half glad when it is night, and sleep,"
4740,366,"if, haply, thro' a dream, to peep"
4741,366,"in parlors, shut by day."
4742,366,and if i do—when morning comes—
4743,366,it is as if a hundred drums
4744,366,"did round my pillow roll,"
4745,366,"and shouts fill all my childish sky,"
4746,366,"and bells keep saying ""victory"""
4747,366,from steeples in my soul!
4748,366,and if i don't—the little bird
4749,366,"within the orchard, is not heard,"
4750,366,and i omit to pray
4751,366,"""father, thy will be done"" today"
4752,366,"for my will goes the other way,"
4753,366,and it were perjury!
4754,367,"i have never seen ""volcanoes""—"
4755,367,"but, when travellers tell"
4756,367,how those old—phlegmatic mountains
4757,367,usually so still—
4758,367,"bear within—appalling ordnance,"
4759,367,"fire, and smoke, and gun,"
4760,367,"taking villages for breakfast,"
4761,367,and appalling men—
4762,367,if the stillness is volcanic
4763,367,in the human face
4764,367,when upon a pain titanic
4765,367,features keep their place—
4766,367,if at length the smouldering anguish
4767,367,will not overcome—
4768,367,and the palpitating vineyard
4769,367,"in the dust, be thrown?"
4770,367,"if some loving antiquary,"
4771,367,"on resumption morn,"
4772,367,"will not cry with joy ""pompeii""!"
4773,367,to the hills return!
4774,368,i haven't told my garden yet—
4775,368,lest that should conquer me.
4776,368,i haven't quite the strength now
4777,368,to break it to the bee—
4778,368,i will not name it in the street
4779,368,for shops would stare at me—
4780,368,that one so shy—so ignorant
4781,368,should have the face to die.
4782,368,the hillsides must not know it—
4783,368,where i have rambled so—
4784,368,nor tell the loving forests
4785,368,the day that i shall go—
4786,368,nor lisp it at the table—
4787,368,nor heedless by the way
4788,368,hint that within the riddle
4789,368,one will walk today—
4790,369,i heard a fly buzz   when i died  
4791,369,the stillness in the room
4792,369,was like the stillness in the air  
4793,369,between the heaves of storm  
4794,369,the eyes around   had wrung them dry  
4795,369,and breaths were gathering firm
4796,369,for that last onset   when the king
4797,369,be witnessed   in the room  
4798,369,i willed my keepsakes   signed away
4799,369,what portion of me be
4800,369,assignable   and then it was
4801,369,there interposed a fly  
4802,369,with blue   uncertain stumbling buzz  
4803,369,between the light   and me  
4804,369,and then the windows failed   and then
4805,369,i could not see to see  
4806,370,i held a jewel in my fingers—
4807,370,and went to sleep—
4808,370,"the day was warm, and winds were prosy—"
4809,370,"i said ""'twill keep""—"
4810,370,"i woke—and chid my honest fingers,"
4811,370,the gem was gone—
4812,370,"and now, an amethyst remembrance"
4813,370,is all i own—
4814,371,"i hide myself within my flower,"
4815,371,"that fading from your vase,"
4816,371,"you, unsuspecting, feel for me—"
4817,371,almost a loneliness.
4818,372,i keep my pledge.
4819,372,i was not called—
4820,372,death did not notice me.
4821,372,i bring my rose.
4822,372,"i plight again,"
4823,372,by every sainted bee—
4824,372,by daisy called from hillside—
4825,372,by bobolink from lane.
4826,372,blossom and i—
4827,372,"her oath, and mine—"
4828,372,will surely come again.
4829,373,i know a place where summer strives
4830,373,"with such a practised frost,"
4831,373,"she each year leads her daisies back,"
4832,373,"recording briefly, ""lost."""
4833,373,but when the south wind stirs the pools
4834,373,"and struggles in the lanes,"
4835,373,"her heart missives her for her vow,"
4836,373,and she pours soft refrains
4837,373,"into the lap of adamant,"
4838,373,"and spices, and the dew,"
4839,373,that stiffens quietly to quartz
4840,373,upon her amber shoe.
4841,374,"i know lives, i could miss"
4842,374,without a misery—
4843,374,others—whose instant's wanting—
4844,374,would be eternity—
4845,374,the last—a scanty number—
4846,374,'twould scarcely fill a two—
4847,374,the first—a gnat's horizon
4848,374,could easily outgrow—
4849,375,i know some lonely houses off the road
4850,375,a robber'd like the look of—
4851,375,"wooden barred,"
4852,375,"and windows hanging low,"
4853,375,inviting to—
4854,375,"a portico,"
4855,375,where two could creep—
4856,375,one—hand the tools—
4857,375,the other peep—
4858,375,to make sure all's asleep—
4859,375,old fashioned eyes—
4860,375,not easy to surprise!
4861,375,"how orderly the kitchen'd look, by night,"
4862,375,with just a clock—
4863,375,but they could gag the tick—
4864,375,and mice won't bark—
4865,375,and so the walls—don't tell—
4866,375,none—will—
4867,375,a pair of spectacles ajar just stir—
4868,375,an almanac's aware—
4869,375,"was it the mat—winked,"
4870,375,or a nervous star?
4871,375,"the moon—slides down the stair,"
4872,375,to see who's there!
4873,375,there's plunder—where—
4874,375,"tankard, or spoon—"
4875,375,earring—or stone—
4876,375,a watch—some ancient brooch
4877,375,to match the grandmama—
4878,375,staid sleeping—there—
4879,375,day—rattles—too
4880,375,stealth's—slow—
4881,375,the sun has got as far
4882,375,as the third sycamore—
4883,375,screams chanticleer
4884,375,"""who's there""?"
4885,375,"and echoes—trains away,"
4886,375,"sneer—""where""!"
4887,375,"while the old couple, just astir,"
4888,375,fancy the sunrise—left the door ajar!
4889,376,i know that he exists.
4890,376,somewhere—in silence—
4891,376,he has hid his rare life
4892,376,from our gross eyes.
4893,376,'tis an instant's play.
4894,376,'tis a fond ambush—
4895,376,just to make bliss
4896,376,earn her own surprise!
4897,376,but—should the play
4898,376,prove piercing earnest—
4899,376,should the glee—glaze—
4900,376,in death's—stiff—stare—
4901,376,would not the fun
4902,376,look too expensive!
4903,376,would not the jest—
4904,376,have crawled too far!
4905,377,i know where wells grow—droughtless wells—
4906,377,deep dug—for summer days—
4907,377,where mosses go no more away—
4908,377,and pebble—safely plays—
4909,377,it's made of fathoms—and a belt—
4910,377,a belt of jagged stone—
4911,377,inlaid with emerald—half way down—
4912,377,and diamonds—jumbled on—
4913,377,it has no bucket—were i rich
4914,377,a bucket i would buy—
4915,377,i'm often thirsty—but my lips
4916,377,are so high up—you see—
4917,377,i read in an old fashioned book
4918,377,"that people ""thirst no more""—"
4919,377,the wells have buckets to them there—
4920,377,it must mean that—i'm sure—
4921,377,shall we remember parching—then?
4922,377,those waters sound so grand—
4923,377,i think a little well—like mine—
4924,377,dearer to understand—
4925,378,i learned—at least—what home could be—
4926,378,how ignorant i had been
4927,378,of pretty ways of covenant—
4928,378,how awkward at the hymn
4929,378,round our new fireside—but for this—
4930,378,this pattern—of the way—
4931,378,"whose memory drowns me, like the dip"
4932,378,of a celestial sea—
4933,378,what mornings in our garden—guessed—
4934,378,what bees—for us—to hum—
4935,378,with only birds to interrupt
4936,378,the ripple of our theme—
4937,378,and task for both—
4938,378,when play be done—
4939,378,your problem—of the brain—
4940,378,and mine—some foolisher effect—
4941,378,a ruffle—or a tune—
4942,378,the afternoons—together spent—
4943,378,and twilight—in the lanes—
4944,378,some ministry to poorer lives—
4945,378,seen poorest—thro' our gains—
4946,378,and then return—and night—and home—
4947,378,and then away to you to pass—
4948,378,a new—diviner—care—
4949,378,till sunrise take us back to scene—
4950,378,transmuted—vivider—
4951,378,this seems a home—
4952,378,and home is not—
4953,378,but what that place could be—
4954,378,afflicts me—as a setting sun—
4955,378,where dawn—knows how to be—
4956,379,"i like a look of agony,"
4957,379,because i know it's true—
4958,379,"men do not sham convulsion,"
4959,379,"nor simulate, a throe—"
4960,379,the eyes glaze once—and that is death—
4961,379,impossible to feign
4962,379,the beads upon the forehead
4963,379,by homely anguish strung.
4964,380,i like to see it lap the miles—
4965,380,and lick the valleys up—
4966,380,and stop to feed itself at tanks—
4967,380,and then—prodigious step
4968,380,around a pile of mountains—
4969,380,and supercilious peer
4970,380,in shanties—by the sides of roads—
4971,380,and then a quarry pare
4972,380,to fit its ribs
4973,380,and crawl between
4974,380,complaining all the while
4975,380,in horrid—hooting stanza—
4976,380,then chase itself down hill—
4977,380,and neigh like boanerges—
4978,380,then—punctual as a star
4979,380,stop—docile and omnipotent
4980,380,at its own stable door—
4981,381,i live with him—i see his face—
4982,381,i go no more away
4983,381,for visitor—or sundown—
4984,381,death's single privacy
4985,381,the only one—forestalling mine—
4986,381,and that—by right that he
4987,381,presents a claim invisible—
4988,381,no wedlock—granted me—
4989,381,i live with him—i hear his voice—
4990,381,i stand alive—today—
4991,381,to witness to the certainty
4992,381,of immortality—
4993,381,taught me—by time—the lower way—
4994,381,conviction—every day—
4995,381,that life like this—is stopless—
4996,381,be judgment—what it may—
4997,382,i lived on dread; to those who know
4998,382,the stimulus there is
4999,382,"in danger, other impetus"
5000,382,is numb and vital-less.
5001,382,"as't were a spur upon the soul,"
5002,382,a fear will urge it where
5003,382,to go without the spectre's aid
5004,382,were challenging despair.
5005,383,i lost a world - the other day!
5006,383,has anybody found?
5007,383,you'll know it by the row of stars
5008,383,around its forehead bound.
5009,383,a rich man—might not notice it—
5010,383,"yet—to my frugal eye,"
5011,383,of more esteem than ducats—
5012,383,oh find it—sir—for me!
5013,384,i made slow riches but my gain
5014,384,was steady as the sun
5015,384,"and every night, it numbered more"
5016,384,than the preceding one
5017,384,"all days, i did not earn the same"
5018,384,but my perceiveless gain
5019,384,inferred the less by growing than
5020,384,the sum that it had grown.
5021,385,i make his crescent fill or lack—
5022,385,his nature is at full
5023,385,or quarter—as i signify—
5024,385,his tides—do i control—
5025,385,he holds superior in the sky
5026,385,"or gropes, at my command"
5027,385,behind inferior clouds—or round
5028,385,a mist's slow colonnade—
5029,385,but since we hold a mutual disc—
5030,385,and front a mutual day—
5031,385,"which is the despot, neither knows—"
5032,385,nor whose—the tyranny—
5033,386,i many times thought peace had come
5034,386,when peace was far away—
5035,386,as wrecked men—deem they sight the land—
5036,386,at centre of the sea—
5037,386,and struggle slacker—but to prove
5038,386,as hopelessly as i—
5039,386,how many the fictitious shores—
5040,386,before the harbor be—
5041,387,i meant to find her when i came—
5042,387,death—had the same design—
5043,387,but the success—was his—it seems—
5044,387,and the surrender—mine—
5045,387,i meant to tell her how i longed
5046,387,for just this single time—
5047,387,but death had told her so the first—
5048,387,"and she had past, with him—"
5049,387,to wander—now—is my repose—
5050,387,to rest—to rest would be
5051,387,a privilege of hurricane
5052,387,to memory—and me.
5053,388,i meant to have but modest needs—
5054,388,such as content—and heaven—
5055,388,within my income—these could lie
5056,388,and life and i—keep even—
5057,388,but since the last—included both—
5058,388,it would suffice my prayer
5059,388,but just for one—to stipulate—
5060,388,and grace would grant the pair—
5061,388,and so—upon this wise—i prayed—
5062,388,great spirit—give to me
5063,388,"a heaven not so large as yours,"
5064,388,but large enough—for me—
5065,388,a smile suffused jehovah's face—
5066,388,the cherubim—withdrew—
5067,388,grave saints stole out to look at me—
5068,388,and showed their dimples—too—
5069,388,"i left the place, with all my might—"
5070,388,i threw my prayer away—
5071,388,the quiet ages picked it up—
5072,388,and judgment—twinkled—too—
5073,388,tat one so honest—be extant—
5074,388,it take the tale for true—
5075,388,"that ""whatsoever ye shall ask—"
5076,388,"itself be given you""—"
5077,388,"but i, grown shrewder—scan the skies"
5078,388,with a suspicious air—
5079,388,as children—swindled for the first
5080,388,all swindlers—be—infer—
5081,389,i measure every grief i meet
5082,389,  with analytic eyes;
5083,389,"i wonder if it weighs like mine,"
5084,389,  or has an easier size.
5085,389,"i wonder if they bore it long,"
5086,389,  or did it just begin?
5087,389,"i could not tell the date of mine,"
5088,389,  it feels so old a pain.
5089,389,"i wonder if it hurts to live,"
5090,389,"  and if they have to try,"
5091,389,"and whether, could they choose between,"
5092,389,  they would not rather die.
5093,389,i wonder if when years have piled 
5094,389,  some thousands on the cause
5095,389,"of early hurt, if such a lapse"
5096,389,  could give them any pause;
5097,389,or would they go on aching still
5098,389,"  through centuries above,"
5099,389,enlightened to a larger pain
5100,389,  by contrast with the love.
5101,389,"the grieved are many, i am told;"
5102,389,"  the reason deeper lies, "
5103,389,death is but one and comes but once
5104,389,  and only nails the eyes.
5105,389,"there's grief of want, and grief of cold, "
5106,389,"  a sort they call 'despair,'"
5107,389,"there's banishment from native eyes,"
5108,389,  in sight of native air.
5109,389,and though i may not guess the kind
5110,389,  correctly yet to me
5111,389,a piercing comfort it affords
5112,389,"  in passing calvary,"
5113,389,to note the fashions of the cross
5114,389,  of those that stand alone
5115,389,still fascinated to presume
5116,389,  that some are like my own.
5117,390,i met a king this afternoon!
5118,390,"he had not on a crown indeed,"
5119,390,"a little palmleaf hat was all,"
5120,390,"and he was barefoot, i'm afraid!"
5121,390,but sure i am he ermine wore
5122,390,beneath his faded jacket's blue—
5123,390,"and sure i am, the crest he bore"
5124,390,within that jacket's pocket too!
5125,390,for 'twas too stately for an earl—
5126,390,a marquis would not go so grand!
5127,390,'twas possibly a czar petite—
5128,390,"a pope, or something of that kind!"
5129,390,"if i must tell you, of a horse"
5130,390,my freckled monarch held the rein—
5131,390,"doubtless an estimable beast,"
5132,390,but not at all disposed to run!
5133,390,and such a wagon! while i live
5134,390,dare i presume to see
5135,390,another such a vehicle
5136,390,as then transported me!
5137,390,two other ragged princes
5138,390,his royal state partook!
5139,390,doubtless the first excursion
5140,390,these sovereigns ever took!
5141,390,i question if the royal coach
5142,390,round which the footmen wait
5143,390,"has the significance, on high,"
5144,390,of this barefoot estate!
5145,391,i never felt at home—below—-
5146,391,and in the handsome skies
5147,391,i shall not feel at home—i know—
5148,391,i don't like paradise—
5149,391,because it's sunday—all the time—
5150,391,and recess—never comes—
5151,391,and eden'll be so lonesome
5152,391,bright wednesday afternoons—
5153,391,if god could make a visit—
5154,391,or ever took a nap—
5155,391,so not to see us—but they say
5156,391,himself—a telescope
5157,391,perennial beholds us—
5158,391,myself would run away
5159,391,from him—and holy ghost—and all—
5160,391,"but there's the ""judgement day""!"
5161,392,"i never hear the word ""escape"""
5162,392,"without a quicker blood,"
5163,392,"a sudden expectation,"
5164,392,a flying attitude.
5165,392,i never hear of prisons broad
5166,392,"by soldiers battered down,"
5167,392,"but i tug childish at my bars,  "
5168,392,only to fail again!
5169,393,"i never lost as much but twice,"
5170,393,and that was in the sod.
5171,393,twice have i stood a beggar
5172,393,before the door of god!
5173,393,angels—twice descending
5174,393,reimbursed my store—
5175,393,burglar! banker—father!
5176,393,i am poor once more!
5177,394,i never saw a moor;
5178,394,"i never saw the sea,"
5179,394,yet know i how the heather looks
5180,394,and what a billow be.
5181,394,"i never spoke with god,"
5182,394,nor visited in heaven.
5183,394,yet certain am i of the spot
5184,394,as if the checks were given.
5185,395,i never told the buried gold
5186,395,upon the hill—that lies—
5187,395,i saw the sun—his plunder done
5188,395,crouch low to guard his prize.
5189,395,he stood as near
5190,395,as stood you here—
5191,395,a pace had been between—
5192,395,did but a snake bisect the brake
5193,395,my life had forfeit been.
5194,395,that was a wondrous booty—
5195,395,i hope 'twas honest gained.
5196,395,those were the fairest ingots
5197,395,that ever kissed the spade!
5198,395,whether to keep the secret—
5199,395,whether to reveal—
5200,395,whether as i ponder
5201,395,kidd will sudden sail—
5202,395,could a shrewd advise me
5203,395,we might e'en divide—
5204,395,should a shrewd betray me—
5205,395,atropos decide!
5206,396,i often passed the village
5207,396,when going home from school—
5208,396,and wondered what they did there—
5209,396,and why it was so still—
5210,396,i did not know the year then—
5211,396,in which my call would come—
5212,396,"earlier, by the dial,"
5213,396,than the rest have gone.
5214,396,it's stiller than the sundown.
5215,396,it's cooler than the dawn—
5216,396,the daisies dare to come here—
5217,396,and birds can flutter down—
5218,396,so when you are tired—
5219,396,or perplexed—or cold—
5220,396,trust the loving promise
5221,396,"underneath the mould,"
5222,396,"cry ""it's i,"" ""take dollie,"""
5223,396,and i will enfold!
5224,397,i pay—in satin cash—
5225,397,you did not state—your price—
5226,397,"a petal, for a paragraph"
5227,397,it near as i can guess—
5228,398,i play at riches—to appease
5229,398,the clamoring for gold—
5230,398,"it kept me from a thief, i think,"
5231,398,"for often, overbold"
5232,398,"with want, and opportunity—"
5233,398,i could have done a sin
5234,398,and been myself that easy thing
5235,398,an independent man—
5236,398,but often as my lot displays
5237,398,too hungry to be borne
5238,398,i deem myself what i would be—
5239,398,and novel comforting
5240,398,my poverty and i derive—
5241,398,we question if the man—
5242,398,who own—esteem the opulence—
5243,398,as we—who never can—
5244,398,should ever these exploring hands
5245,398,chance sovereign on a mine—
5246,398,or in the long—uneven term
5247,398,"to win, become their turn—"
5248,398,how fitter they will be—for want—
5249,398,enlightening so well—
5250,398,"i know not which, desire, or grant—"
5251,398,be wholly beautiful—
5252,399,"i prayed, at first, a little girl,"
5253,399,because they told me to—
5254,399,"but stopped, when qualified to guess"
5255,399,how prayer would feel—to me—
5256,399,"if i believed god looked around,"
5257,399,each time my childish eye
5258,399,"fixed full, and steady, on his own"
5259,399,in childish honesty—
5260,399,"and told him what i'd like, today,"
5261,399,and parts of his far plan
5262,399,that baffled me—
5263,399,the mingled side
5264,399,of his divinity—
5265,399,"and often since, in danger,"
5266,399,i count the force 'twould be
5267,399,to have a god so strong as that
5268,399,to hold my life for me
5269,399,till i could take the balance
5270,399,"that tips so frequent, now,"
5271,399,it takes me all the while to poise—
5272,399,and then—it doesn't stay—
5273,400,i read my sentence—steadily—
5274,400,"reviewed it with my eyes,"
5275,400,to see that i made no mistake
5276,400,in its extremest clause—
5277,400,"the date, and manner, of the shame—"
5278,400,and then the pious form
5279,400,"that ""god have mercy"" on the soul"
5280,400,the jury voted him—
5281,400,i made my soul familiar—with her extremity—
5282,400,"that at the last, it should not be a novel agony—"
5283,400,"but she, and death, acquainted—"
5284,400,"meet tranquilly, as friends—"
5285,400,"salute, and pass, without a hint—"
5286,400,"and there, the matter ends—"
5287,401,"i reason, earth is short—"
5288,401,and anguish—absolute—
5289,401,"and many hurt,"
5290,401,"but, what of that?"
5291,401,"i reason, we could die—"
5292,401,the best vitality
5293,401,"cannot excel decay,"
5294,401,"but, what of that?"
5295,401,"i reason, that in heaven—"
5296,401,"somehow, it will be even—"
5297,401,"some new equation, given—"
5298,401,"but, what of that?"
5299,402,i reckon—when i count it all—
5300,402,first—poets—then the sun—
5301,402,then summer—then the heaven of god—
5302,402,and then—the list is done—
5303,402,"but, looking back—the first so seems"
5304,402,to comprehend the whole—
5305,402,the others look a needless show—
5306,402,so i write—poets—all—
5307,402,their summer—lasts a solid year—
5308,402,they can afford a sun
5309,402,the east—would deem extravagant—
5310,402,and if the further heaven—
5311,402,be beautiful as they prepare
5312,402,for those who worship them—
5313,402,it is too difficult a grace—
5314,402,to justify the dream—
5315,403,i robbed the woods—
5316,403,the trusting woods.
5317,403,the unsuspecting trees
5318,403,brought out their burs and mosses
5319,403,my fantasy to please.
5320,403,i scanned their trinkets curious—i grasped—i bore away—
5321,403,what will the solemn hemlock—
5322,403,what will the oak tree say?
5323,404,i rose—because he sank—
5324,404,i thought it would be opposite—
5325,404,but when his power dropped—
5326,404,my soul grew straight.
5327,404,i cheered my fainting prince—
5328,404,i sang firm—even—chants—
5329,404,i helped his film—with hymn—
5330,404,and when the dews drew off
5331,404,that held his forehead stiff—
5332,404,i met him—
5333,404,balm to balm—
5334,404,i told him best—must pass
5335,404,through this low arch of flesh—
5336,404,no casque so brave
5337,404,it spurn the grave—
5338,404,i told him worlds i knew
5339,404,where emperors grew—
5340,404,who recollected us
5341,404,if we were true—
5342,404,and so with thews of hymn—
5343,404,and sinew from within—
5344,404,and ways i knew not that i knew—till then—
5345,404,i lifted him—
5346,405,i saw no way—the heavens were stitched—
5347,405,i felt the columns close—
5348,405,the earth reversed her hemispheres—
5349,405,i touched the universe—
5350,405,and back it slid—and i alone—
5351,405,a speck upon a ball—
5352,405,went out upon circumference—
5353,405,beyond the dip of bell—
5354,406,i see thee better—in the dark—
5355,406,i do not need a light—
5356,406,the love of thee—a prism be—
5357,406,excelling violet—
5358,406,i see thee better for the years
5359,406,that hunch themselves between—
5360,406,the miner's lamp—sufficient be—
5361,406,to nullify the mine—
5362,406,and in the grave—i see thee best—
5363,406,its little panels be
5364,406,aglow—all ruddy—with the light
5365,406,"i held so high, for thee—"
5366,406,what need of day—
5367,406,to those whose dark—hath so—surpassing sun—
5368,406,it deem it be—continually—
5369,406,at the meridian?
5370,407,i send two sunsets—
5371,407,day and i—in competition ran—
5372,407,i finished two—and several stars—
5373,407,while he—was making one—
5374,407,his own was ampler—but as i
5375,407,was saying to a friend—
5376,407,mine—is the more convenient
5377,407,to carry in the hand—
5378,408,i shall keep singing!
5379,408,birds will pass me
5380,408,on their way to yellower climes—
5381,408,each—with a robin's expectation—
5382,408,i—with my redbreast—
5383,408,and my rhymes—
5384,408,late—when i take my place in summer—
5385,408,but—i shall bring a fuller tune—
5386,408,vespers—are sweeter than matins—signor—
5387,408,morning—only the seed of noon—
5388,409,i shall know why—when time is over—
5389,409,and i have ceased to wonder why—
5390,409,christ will explain each separate anguish
5391,409,in the fair schoolroom of the sky—
5392,409,"he will tell me what ""peter"" promised—"
5393,409,and i—for wonder at his woe—
5394,409,i shall forget the drop of anguish
5395,409,that scalds me now—that scalds me now!
5396,410,"i should have been too glad, i see—"
5397,410,too lifted—for the scant degree
5398,410,of life's penurious round—
5399,410,my little circuit would have shamed
5400,410,this new circumference—have blamed—
5401,410,the homelier time behind.
5402,410,i should have been too saved—i see—
5403,410,too rescued—fear too dim to me
5404,410,that i could spell the prayer
5405,410,i knew so perfect—yesterday—
5406,410,that scalding one—sabachthani—
5407,410,recited fluent—here—
5408,410,earth would have been too much—i see—
5409,410,and heaven—not enough for me—
5410,410,i should have had the joy
5411,410,without the fear—to justify—
5412,410,the palm—without the calvary—
5413,410,so savior—crucify—
5414,410,defeat—whets victory—they say—
5415,410,the reefs—in old gethsemane—
5416,410,endear the coast—beyond!
5417,410,'tis beggars—banquets—can define—
5418,410,'tis parching—vitalizes wine—
5419,410,"""faith"" bleats—to understand!"
5420,411,"i should not dare to leave my friend,"
5421,411,because—because if he should die
5422,411,while i was gone—and i—too late—
5423,411,should reach the heart that wanted me—
5424,411,if i should disappoint the eyes
5425,411,that hunted—hunted so—to see—
5426,411,and could not bear to shut until
5427,411,"they ""noticed"" me—they noticed me—"
5428,411,if i should stab the patient faith
5429,411,so sure i'd come—so sure i'd come—
5430,411,it listening—listening—went to sleep—
5431,411,telling my tardy name—
5432,411,my heart would wish it broke before—
5433,411,since breaking then—since breaking then—
5434,411,were useless as next morning's sun—
5435,411,where midnight frosts—had lain!
5436,412,i showed her heights she never saw—
5437,412,"""would'st climb,"" i said?"
5438,412,"she said—""not so""—"
5439,412,"""with me—"" i said—with me?"
5440,412,i showed her secrets—morning's nest—
5441,412,the rope the nights were put across—
5442,412,"and now—""would'st have me for a guest?"""
5443,412,she could not find her yes—
5444,412,"and then, i brake my life—and lo,"
5445,412,"a light, for her, did solemn glow,"
5446,412,"the larger, as her face withdrew—"
5447,412,"and could she, further, ""no""?"
5448,413,i sing to use the waiting
5449,413,my bonnet but to tie
5450,413,and shut the door unto my house
5451,413,no more to do have i
5452,413,till his best step approaching
5453,413,we journey to the day
5454,413,and tell each other how we sung
5455,413,to keep the dark away.
5456,414,"i sometimes drop it, for a quick—"
5457,414,the thought to be alive—
5458,414,anonymous delight to know—
5459,414,and madder—to conceive—
5460,414,consoles a woe so monstrous
5461,414,"that did it tear all day,"
5462,414,without an instant's respite—
5463,414,'twould look too far—to die—
5464,415,i started early - took my dog -
5465,415,and visited the sea -
5466,415,the mermaids in the basement
5467,415,came out to look at me -
5468,415,and frigates - in the upper floor
5469,415,extended hempen hands -
5470,415,presuming me to be a mouse -
5471,415,aground - upon the sands -
5472,415,but no man moved me - till the tide
5473,415,went past my simple shoe -
5474,415,and past my apron - and my belt
5475,415,and past my bodice - too -
5476,415,and made as he would eat me up -
5477,415,as wholly as a dew
5478,415,upon a dandelion's sleeve -
5479,415,and then - i started - too -
5480,415,and he - he followed - close behind -
5481,415,i felt his silver heel
5482,415,upon my ankle - then my shoes
5483,415,would overflow with pearl -
5484,415,until we met the solid town -
5485,415,no one he seemed to know -
5486,415,and bowing - with a mighty look -
5487,415,at me - the sea withdrew -
5488,416,i stepped from plank to plank
5489,416,  so slow and cautiously;
5490,416,"the stars about my head i felt,"
5491,416,  about my feet the sea.
5492,416,i knew not but the next
5493,416,"  would be my final inch, "
5494,416,this gave me that precarious gait
5495,416,  some call experience.
5496,417,i stole them from a bee—
5497,417,because—thee—
5498,417,sweet plea—
5499,417,he pardoned me!
5500,418,"i taste a liquor never brewed,"
5501,418,from tankards scooped in pearl;
5502,418,not all the vats upon the rhine
5503,418,yield such an alcohol!
5504,418,"inebriate of air am i,"
5505,418,"and debauchee of dew,"
5506,418,"reeling, through endless summer days,"
5507,418,from inns of molten blue.
5508,418,when the landlord turn the drunken bee
5509,418,"out of the foxglove's door,"
5510,418,"when butterflies renounce their drams,"
5511,418,i shall but drink the more!
5512,418,"till seraphs swing their snowy hats,"
5513,418,"and saints to windows run,"
5514,418,to see the little tippler
5515,418,leaning against the sun!
5516,419,i tend my flowers for thee—
5517,419,bright absentee!
5518,419,my fuchsia's coral seams
5519,419,rip—while the sower—dreams—
5520,419,geraniums—tint—and spot—
5521,419,low daisies—dot—
5522,419,my cactus—splits her beard
5523,419,to show her throat—
5524,419,carnations—tip their spice—
5525,419,and bees—pick up—
5526,419,a hyacinth—i hid—
5527,419,puts out a ruffled head—
5528,419,and odors fall
5529,419,from flasks—so small—
5530,419,you marvel how they held—
5531,419,globe roses—break their satin glake—
5532,419,upon my garden floor—
5533,419,yet—thou—not there—
5534,419,i had as lief they bore
5535,419,no crimson—more—
5536,419,thy flower—be gay—
5537,419,her lord—away!
5538,419,it ill becometh me—
5539,419,i'll dwell in calyx—gray—
5540,419,how modestly—alway—
5541,419,thy daisy—
5542,419,draped for thee!
5543,420,i think i was enchanted
5544,420,when first a sombre girl—
5545,420,i read that foreign lady—
5546,420,the dark—felt beautiful—
5547,420,and whether it was noon at night—
5548,420,or only heaven—at noon—
5549,420,for very lunacy of light
5550,420,i had not power to tell—
5551,420,the bees—became as butterflies—
5552,420,the butterflies—as swans—
5553,420,approached—and spurned the narrow grass—
5554,420,and just the meanest tunes
5555,420,that nature murmured to herself
5556,420,to keep herself in cheer—
5557,420,i took for giants—practising
5558,420,titanic opera—
5559,420,the days—to mighty metres stept—
5560,420,the homeliest—adorned
5561,420,as if unto a jubilee
5562,420,'twere suddenly confirmed—
5563,420,i could not have defined the change—
5564,420,conversion of the mind
5565,420,like sanctifying in the soul—
5566,420,is witnessed—not explained—
5567,420,'twas a divine insanity—
5568,420,the danger to be sane
5569,420,should i again experience—
5570,420,'tis antidote to turn—
5571,420,to tomes of solid witchcraft—
5572,420,magicians be asleep—
5573,420,but magic—hath an element
5574,420,like deity—to keep—
5575,421,i think just how my shape will rise—
5576,421,"when i shall be ""forgiven""—"
5577,421,till hair—and eyes—and timid head—
5578,421,are out of sight—in heaven—
5579,421,i think just how my lips will weigh—
5580,421,with shapeless—quivering—prayer—
5581,421,"that you—so late—""consider"" me—"
5582,421,"the ""sparrow"" of your care—"
5583,421,i mind me that of anguish—sent—
5584,421,some drifts were moved away—
5585,421,before my simple bosom—broke—
5586,421,and why not this—if they?
5587,421,"and so i con that thing—""forgiven""—"
5588,421,until—delirious—borne—
5589,421,by my long bright—and longer—trust—
5590,421,i drop my heart—unshriven!
5591,422,i think the hemlock likes to stand
5592,422,upon a marge of snow—
5593,422,it suits his own austerity—
5594,422,and satisfies an awe
5595,422,"that men, must slake in wilderness—"
5596,422,and in the desert—cloy—
5597,422,"an instinct for the hoar, the bald—"
5598,422,lapland's—necessity—
5599,422,the hemlock's nature thrives—on cold—
5600,422,the gnash of northern winds
5601,422,is sweetest nutriment—to him—
5602,422,his best norwegian wines—
5603,422,to satin races—he is nought—
5604,422,"but children on the don,"
5605,422,"beneath his tabernacles, play,"
5606,422,"and dnieper wrestlers, run."
5607,423,i think the longest hour of all
5608,423,is when the cars have come—
5609,423,and we are waiting for the coach—
5610,423,it seems as though the time
5611,423,indignant—that the joy was come—
5612,423,did block the gilded hands—
5613,423,and would not let the seconds by—
5614,423,but slowest instant—ends—
5615,423,the pendulum begins to count—
5616,423,like little scholars—loud—
5617,423,the steps grow thicker—in the hall—
5618,423,the heart begins to crowd—
5619,423,then i—my timid service done—
5620,423,"tho' service 'twas, of love—"
5621,423,take up my little violin—
5622,423,and further north—remove.
5623,424,i think to live—may be a bliss
5624,424,to those who dare to try—
5625,424,beyond my limit to conceive—
5626,424,my lip—to testify—
5627,424,i think the heart i former wore
5628,424,could widen—till to me
5629,424,"the other, like the little bank"
5630,424,appear—unto the sea—
5631,424,i think the days—could every one
5632,424,in ordination stand—
5633,424,and majesty—be easier—
5634,424,than an inferior kind—
5635,424,no numb alarm—lest difference come—
5636,424,no goblin—on the bloom—
5637,424,"no start in apprehension's ear,"
5638,424,no bankruptcy—no doom—
5639,424,but certainties of sun—
5640,424,midsummer—in the mind—
5641,424,a steadfast south—upon the soul—
5642,424,her polar time—behind—
5643,424,the vision—pondered long—
5644,424,so plausible becomes
5645,424,that i esteem the fiction—real—
5646,424,the real—fictitious seems—
5647,424,how bountiful the dream—
5648,424,what plenty—it would be—
5649,424,had all my life but been mistake
5650,424,just rectified—in thee
5651,425,i tie my hat—i crease my shawl—
5652,425,life's little duties do—precisely—
5653,425,as the very least
5654,425,were infinite—to me—
5655,425,i put new blossoms in the glass—
5656,425,and throw the old—away—
5657,425,i push a petal from my gown
5658,425,that anchored there—i weigh
5659,425,the time 'twill be till six o'clock
5660,425,i have so much to do—
5661,425,and yet—existence—some way back—
5662,425,stopped—struck—my tickling—through—
5663,425,we cannot put ourself away
5664,425,as a completed man
5665,425,or woman—when the errand's done
5666,425,we came to flesh—upon—
5667,425,there may be—miles on miles of nought—
5668,425,of action—sicker far—
5669,425,to simulate—is stinging work—
5670,425,to cover what we are
5671,425,from science—and from surgery—
5672,425,too telescopic eyes
5673,425,to bear on us unshaded—
5674,425,for their—sake—not for ours—
5675,425,'twould start them—
5676,425,we—could tremble—
5677,425,but since we got a bomb—
5678,425,and held it in our bosom—
5679,425,nay—hold it—it is calm—
5680,425,therefore—we do life's labor—
5681,425,though life's reward—be done—
5682,425,with scrupulous exactness—
5683,425,to hold our senses—on—
5684,426,i took my power in my hand—
5685,426,and went against the world—
5686,426,'twas not so much as david—had—
5687,426,but i—was twice as bold—
5688,426,i aimed by pebble—but myself
5689,426,was all the one that fell—
5690,426,was it goliath—was too large—
5691,426,or was myself—too small?
5692,427,i tried to think a lonelier thing
5693,427,than any i had seen—
5694,427,some polar expiation—an omen in the bone
5695,427,of death's tremendous nearness—
5696,427,i probed retrieverless things
5697,427,my duplicate—to borrow—
5698,427,a haggard comfort springs
5699,427,from the belief that somewhere—
5700,427,within the clutch of thought—
5701,427,there dwells one other creature
5702,427,of heavenly love—forgot—
5703,427,i plucked at our partition
5704,427,as one should pry the walls—
5705,427,between himself—and horror's twin—
5706,427,within opposing cells—
5707,427,"i almost strove to clasp his hand,"
5708,427,such luxury—it grew—
5709,427,that as myself—could pity him—
5710,427,perhaps he—pitied me—
5711,428,"""i want""—it pleaded—all its life—"
5712,428,i want—was chief it said
5713,428,when skill entreated it—the last—
5714,428,and when so newly dead—
5715,428,i could not deem it late—to hear
5716,428,that single—steadfast sigh—
5717,428,"the lips had placed as with a ""please"""
5718,428,toward eternity—
5719,429,i was the slightest in the house—
5720,429,i took the smallest room—
5721,429,"at night, my little lamp, and book—"
5722,429,and one geranium—
5723,429,so stationed i could catch the mint
5724,429,that never ceased to fall—
5725,429,and just my basket—
5726,429,let me think—i'm sure—
5727,429,that this was all—
5728,429,i never spoke—unless addressed—
5729,429,"and then, 'twas brief and low—"
5730,429,i could not bear to live—aloud—
5731,429,the racket shamed me so—
5732,429,and if it had not been so far—
5733,429,and any one i knew
5734,429,were going—i had often thought
5735,429,how noteless—i could die—
5736,430,i watched the moon around the house
5737,430,until upon a pane—
5738,430,she stopped—a traveller's privilege—for rest—
5739,430,and there upon
5740,430,i gazed—as at a stranger—
5741,430,the lady in the town
5742,430,doth think no incivility
5743,430,to lift her glass—upon—
5744,430,but never stranger justified
5745,430,the curiosity
5746,430,like mine—for not a foot—nor hand—
5747,430,nor formula—had she—
5748,430,but like a head—a guillotine
5749,430,slid carelessly away—
5750,430,"did independent, amber—"
5751,430,sustain her in the sky—
5752,430,or like a stemless flower—
5753,430,upheld in rolling air
5754,430,by finer gravitations—
5755,430,than bind philosopher—
5756,430,no hunger—had she—nor an inn—
5757,430,her toilette—to suffice—
5758,430,nor avocation—nor concern
5759,430,for little mysteries
5760,430,as harass us—like life—and death—
5761,430,and afterwards—or nay—
5762,430,but seemed engrossed to absolute—
5763,430,with shining—and the sky—
5764,430,the privilege to scrutinize
5765,430,was scarce upon my eyes
5766,430,"when, with a silver practise—"
5767,430,she vaulted out of gaze—
5768,430,and next—i met her on a cloud—
5769,430,myself too far below
5770,430,to follow her superior road—
5771,430,or its advantage—blue—
5772,431,"i went to heaven, "
5773,431,"'t was a small town,"
5774,431,"lit with a ruby,"
5775,431,lathed with down.
5776,431,stiller than the fields
5777,431,"at the full dew,"
5778,431,beautiful as pictures
5779,431,no man drew.
5780,431,"people like the moth,"
5781,431,"of mechlin, frames,"
5782,431,"duties of gossamer,"
5783,431,and eider names.
5784,431,almost contented
5785,431,i could be
5786,431,'mong such unique
5787,431,society.
5788,432,i went to thank her—
5789,432,but she slept—
5790,432,her bed—a funneled stone—
5791,432,with nosegays at the head and foot—
5792,432,that travellers—had thrown—
5793,432,who went to thank her—
5794,432,but she slept—
5795,432,'twas short—to cross the sea—
5796,432,to look upon her like—alive—
5797,432,but turning back—'twas slow—
5798,433,"i would distill a cup,"
5799,433,"and bear to all my friends,"
5800,433,"drinking to her no more astir,"
5801,433,"by beck, or burn, or moor!"
5802,434,i would not paint—a picture—
5803,434,i'd rather be the one
5804,434,its bright impossibility
5805,434,to dwell—delicious—on—
5806,434,and wonder how the fingers feel
5807,434,whose rare—celestial—stir—
5808,434,evokes so sweet a torment—
5809,434,such sumptuous—despair—
5810,434,"i would not talk, like cornets—"
5811,434,i'd rather be the one
5812,434,raised softly to the ceilings—
5813,434,"and out, and easy on—"
5814,434,through villages of ether—
5815,434,myself endued balloon
5816,434,by but a lip of metal—
5817,434,the pier to my pontoon—
5818,434,nor would i be a poet—
5819,434,it's finer—own the ear—
5820,434,enamored—impotent—content—
5821,434,"the license to revere,"
5822,434,a privilege so awful
5823,434,"what would the dower be,"
5824,434,had i the art to stun myself
5825,434,with bolts of melody!
5826,435,i years had been from home
5827,435,and now before the door
5828,435,"i dared not enter, lest a face"
5829,435,i never saw before
5830,435,stare solid into mine
5831,435,and ask my business there—
5832,435,"""my business but a life i left"
5833,435,"was such remaining there?"""
5834,435,i leaned upon the awe—
5835,435,i lingered with before—
5836,435,the second like an ocean rolled
5837,435,and broke against my ear—
5838,435,i laughed a crumbling laugh
5839,435,that i could fear a door
5840,435,who consternation compassed
5841,435,and never winced before.
5842,435,i fitted to the latch
5843,435,"my hand, with trembling care"
5844,435,lest back the awful door should spring
5845,435,and leave me in the floor—
5846,435,then moved my fingers off
5847,435,as cautiously as glass
5848,435,"and held my ears, and like a thief"
5849,435,fled gasping from the house—
5850,436,"i years had been from home,"
5851,436,"and now, before the door,"
5852,436,"i dared not open, lest a face"
5853,436,i never saw before
5854,436,stare vacant into mine
5855,436,and ask my business there.
5856,436,"my business, just a life i left,"
5857,436,was such still dwelling there?
5858,436,"i fumbled at my nerve,"
5859,436,i scanned the windows near;
5860,436,"the silence like an ocean rolled,"
5861,436,and broke against my ear.
5862,436,i laughed a wooden laugh
5863,436,"that i could fear a door,"
5864,436,"who danger and the dead had faced,"
5865,436,but never quaked before.
5866,436,i fitted to the latch
5867,436,"my hand, with trembling care,"
5868,436,"lest back the awful door should spring,"
5869,436,and leave me standing there.
5870,436,i moved my fingers off
5871,436,"as cautiously as glass,"
5872,436,"and held my ears, and like a thief"
5873,436,fled gasping from the house.
5874,437,i'll clutch—and clutch—
5875,437,next—one—might be the golden touch—
5876,437,could take it—
5877,437,diamonds—wait—
5878,437,i'm diving—just a little late—
5879,437,but stars—go slow—for night—
5880,437,i'll string you—in fine necklace—
5881,437,tiaras—make—of some—
5882,437,wear you on hem—
5883,437,loop up a countess—with you—
5884,437,make—a diadem—and mend my old one—
5885,437,count—hoard—then lose—
5886,437,and doubt that you are mine—
5887,437,to have the joy of feeling it—again—
5888,437,i'll show you at the court—
5889,437,bear you—for ornament
5890,437,where women breathe—
5891,437,that every sigh—may lift you
5892,437,just as high—as i—
5893,437,and—when i die—
5894,437,in meek array—display you—
5895,437,still to show—how rich i go—
5896,437,lest skies impeach a wealth so wonderful—
5897,437,and banish me—
5898,438,i'll send the feather from my hat!
5899,438,who knows—but at the sight of that
5900,438,my sovereign will relent?
5901,438,as trinket—worn by faded child—
5902,438,confronting eyes long—comforted—
5903,438,blisters the adamant!
5904,439,"i'll tell you how the sun rose,  "
5905,439,a ribbon at a time.
5906,439,"the steeples swam in amethyst,"
5907,439,the news like squirrels ran.
5908,439,"the hill untied their bonnets,"
5909,439,the bobolinks begun.

5912,439,...................................
5913,439,"but how he set, i know not."
5914,439,there seemed a purple stile
5915,439,which little yellow boys and girls
5916,439,were climbing all the while
5917,439,"till when they reached the other side,"
5918,439,a dominie in gray
5919,439,"put gently up the evening bars,  "
5920,439,and led the flock away.
5921,440,"i'm ""wife""—i've finished that—"
5922,440,that other state—
5923,440,"i'm czar—i'm ""woman"" now—"
5924,440,it's safer so—
5925,440,how odd the girl's life looks
5926,440,behind this soft eclipse—
5927,440,i think that earth feels so
5928,440,to folks in heaven—now—
5929,440,this being comfort—then
5930,440,that other kind—was pain—
5931,440,but why compare?
5932,440,"i'm ""wife""! stop there!"
5933,441,i'm ceded—i've stopped being theirs—
5934,441,the name they dropped upon my face
5935,441,"with water, in the country church"
5936,441,"is finished using, now,"
5937,441,"and they can put it with my dolls,"
5938,441,"my childhood, and the string of spools,"
5939,441,i've finished threading—too—
5940,441,"baptized, before, without the choice,"
5941,441,"but this time, consciously, of grace—"
5942,441,unto supremest name—
5943,441,called to my full—the crescent dropped—
5944,441,"existence's whole arc, filled up,"
5945,441,with one small diadem.
5946,441,my second rank—too small the first—
5947,441,crowned—crowing—on my father's breast—
5948,441,a half unconscious queen—
5949,441,"but this time—adequate—erect,"
5950,441,"with will to choose, or to reject,"
5951,441,"and i choose, just a crown—"
5952,442,i'm nobody! who are you?
5953,442,"are you nobody, too?"
5954,442,then there's a pair of us   don't tell!
5955,442,they'd advertise   you know!
5956,442,how dreary to be somebody!
5957,442,how public like a frog
5958,442,to tell one's name the livelong day
5959,442,to an admiring bog!
5960,443,i'm saying every day
5961,443,"""if i should be a queen, tomorrow""—"
5962,443,i'd do this way—
5963,443,"and so i deck, a little,"
5964,443,"if it be, i wake a bourbon,"
5965,443,"none on me, bend supercilious—"
5966,443,"with ""this was she—"

5968,443,"yesterday."""
5969,443,court is a stately place—

5973,443,that not too plain—
5974,443,rank—overtake me—
5975,443,and perch my tongue
5976,443,on twigs of singing—rather high—
5977,443,"but this, might be my brief term"
5978,443,to qualify—
5979,443,put from my simple speech all plain word—
5980,443,"take other accents, as such i heard"
5981,443,"though but for the cricket—just,"
5982,443,and but for the bee—
5983,443,not in all the meadow—
5984,443,one accost me—
5985,443,better to be ready—
5986,443,than did next morn
5987,443,meet me in aragon—
5988,443,my old gown—on—
5989,443,and the surprised air

5992,443,to exeter—
5993,444,i'm sorry for the dead—today—
5994,444,it's such congenial times
5995,444,old neighbors have at fences—
5996,444,it's time o' year for hay.
5997,444,and broad—sunburned acquaintance
5998,444,discourse between the toil—
5999,444,"and laugh, a homely species"
6000,444,that makes the fences smile—
6001,444,it seems so straight to lie away
6002,444,from all of the noise of fields—
6003,444,the busy carts—the fragrant cocks—
6004,444,the mower's metre—steals—
6005,444,a trouble lest they're homesick—
6006,444,those farmers—and their wives—
6007,444,set separate from the farming—
6008,444,and all the neighbors' lives—
6009,444,a wonder if the sepulchre
6010,444,don't feel a lonesome way—
6011,444,"when men—and boys—and carts—and june,"
6012,444,"go down the fields to ""hay""—"
6013,445,"i'm the little ""heart's ease""!"
6014,445,i don't care for pouting skies!
6015,445,if the butterfly delay
6016,445,"can i, therefore, stay away?"
6017,445,if the coward bumble bee
6018,445,"in his chimney corner stay,"

6020,445,who'll apologize for me?
6021,445,"dear, old fashioned, little flower!"
6022,445,"eden is old fashioned, too!"
6023,445,birds are antiquated fellows!
6024,445,heaven does not change her blue.
6025,445,"nor will i, the little heart's ease—"
6026,445,ever be induced to do!
6027,446,"i've heard an organ talk, sometimes"
6028,446,"in a cathedral aisle,"
6029,446,and understood no word it said—
6030,446,"yet held my breath, the while—"
6031,446,"and risen up—and gone away,"
6032,446,a more berdardine girl—
6033,446,yet—know not what was done to me
6034,446,in that old chapel aisle.
6035,447,"i've known a heaven, like a tent—"
6036,447,to wrap its shining yards—
6037,447,"pluck up its stakes, and disappear—"
6038,447,without the sound of boards
6039,447,or rip of nail—or carpenter—
6040,447,but just the miles of stare—
6041,447,that signalize a show's retreat—
6042,447,in north america—
6043,447,no trace—no figment of the thing
6044,447,"that dazzled, yesterday,"
6045,447,no ring—no marvel—
6046,447,"men, and feats—"
6047,447,dissolved as utterly—
6048,447,as bird's far navigation
6049,447,discloses just a hue—
6050,447,"a plash of oars, a gaiety—"
6051,447,"then swallowed up, of view."
6052,448,i've none to tell me to but thee
6053,448,"so when thou failest, nobody."
6054,448,it was a little tie—
6055,448,"it just held two, nor those it held"
6056,448,since somewhere thy sweet face has spilled
6057,448,beyond my boundary—
6058,448,if things were opposite—and me
6059,448,and me it were—that ebbed from thee
6060,448,on some unanswering shore—
6061,448,would'st thou seek so—just say
6062,448,that i the answer may pursue
6063,448,unto the lips it eddied through—
6064,448,so—overtaking thee—
6065,449,"i've nothing else—to bring, you know—"
6066,449,so i keep bringing these—
6067,449,just as the night keeps fetching stars
6068,449,to our familiar eyes—
6069,449,"maybe, we shouldn't mind them—"
6070,449,unless they didn't come—
6071,449,"then—maybe, it would puzzle us"
6072,449,to find our way home—
6073,450,i've seen a dying eye
6074,450,run round and round a room—
6075,450,in search of something—as it seemed—
6076,450,then cloudier become—
6077,450,and then—obscure with fog—
6078,450,and then—be soldered down
6079,450,without disclosing what it be
6080,450,'twere blessed to have seen—
6081,451,"i’ll tell you how the sun rose, -"

6098,452,with which we help the wheel

6100,452,the eye rejects the oil.
6101,453,"if any sink, assure that this, now standing—"
6102,453,failed like themselves—and conscious that it rose—
6103,453,"grew by the fact, and not the understanding"
6104,453,how weakness passed—or force—arose—
6105,453,"tell that the worst, is easy in a moment—"
6106,453,"dread, but the whizzing, before the ball—"
6107,453,"when the ball enters, enters silence—"
6108,453,dying—annuls the power to kill.
6109,454,if anybody's friend be dead
6110,454,it's sharpest of the theme
6111,454,the thinking how they walked alive—
6112,454,at such and such a time—
6113,454,"their costume, of a sunday,"
6114,454,some manner of the hair—
6115,454,a prank nobody knew but them
6116,454,"lost, in the sepulchre—"
6117,454,"how warm, they were, on such a day,"
6118,454,you almost feel the date—
6119,454,so short way off it seems—
6120,454,and now—they're centuries from that—
6121,454,"how pleased they were, at what you said—"
6122,454,you try to touch the smile
6123,454,and dip your fingers in the frost—
6124,454,when was it—can you tell—
6125,454,you asked the company to tea—
6126,454,acquaintance—just a few—
6127,454,and chatted close with this grand thing
6128,454,that don't remember you—
6129,454,"past bows, and invitations—"
6130,454,"past interview, and vow—"
6131,454,past what ourself can estimate—
6132,454,that—makes the quick of woe!
6133,455,if blame be my side—forfeit me—
6134,455,but doom me not to forfeit thee—
6135,455,to forfeit thee? the very name
6136,455,is sentence from belief—and house—
6137,456,if he dissolve—then—there is nothing—more—
6138,456,eclipse—at midnight—
6139,456,it was dark—before—
6140,456,sunset—at easter—
6141,456,blindness—on the dawn—
6142,456,faint star of bethlehem—
6143,456,gone down!
6144,456,would but some god—inform him—
6145,456,or it be too late!
6146,456,say—that the pulse just lisps—
6147,456,the chariots wait—
6148,456,say—that a little life—for his—
6149,456,is leaking—red—
6150,456,his little spaniel—tell him!
6151,456,will he heed?
6152,457,if he were living—dare i ask—
6153,457,and how if he be dead—
6154,457,and so around the words i went—
6155,457,of meeting them—afraid—
6156,457,i hinted changes—lapse of time—
6157,457,the surfaces of years—
6158,457,i touched with caution—lest they crack—
6159,457,and show me to my fears—
6160,457,reverted to adjoining lives—
6161,457,adroitly turning out
6162,457,wherever i suspected graves—
6163,457,'twas prudenter—i thought—
6164,457,and he—i pushed—with sudden force—
6165,457,in face of the suspense—
6166,457,"""was buried""—""buried""! ""he!"""
6167,457,my life just holds the trench—

6171,458,"or cool one pain,"
6172,458,or help one fainting robin
6173,458,"unto his nest again,"
6174,458,i shall not live in vain.
6175,459,if i could bribe them by a rose
6176,459,i'd bring them every flower that grows
6177,459,from amherst to cashmere!
6178,459,"i would not stop for night, or storm—"
6179,459,"or frost, or death, or anyone—"
6180,459,my business were so dear!
6181,459,if they would linger for a bird
6182,459,my tambourin were soonest heard
6183,459,among the april woods!
6184,459,"unwearied, all the summer long,"
6185,459,only to break in wilder song
6186,459,when winter shook the boughs!
6187,459,what if they hear me!
6188,459,who shall say
6189,459,that such an importunity
6190,459,may not at last avail?
6191,459,"that, weary of this beggar's face—"
6192,459,"they may not finally say, yes—"
6193,459,to drive her from the hall?
6194,460,"if i may have it, when it's dead,"
6195,460,i'll be contented—so—
6196,460,if just as soon as breath is out
6197,460,it shall belong to me—
6198,460,"until they lock it in the grave,"
6199,460,'tis bliss i cannot weigh—
6200,460,"for tho' they lock thee in the grave,"
6201,460,myself—can own the key—
6202,460,think of it lover! i and thee
6203,460,permitted—face to face to be—
6204,460,after a life—a death—we'll say—
6205,460,for death was that—
6206,460,and this—is thee—
6207,460,i'll tell thee all—how bald it grew—
6208,460,"how midnight felt, at first—to me—"
6209,460,how all the clocks stopped in the world—
6210,460,and sunshine pinched me—'twas so cold—
6211,460,then how the grief got sleepy—some—
6212,460,as if my soul were deaf and dumb—
6213,460,just making signs—across—to thee—
6214,460,that this way—thou could'st notice me—
6215,460,i'll tell you how i tried to keep
6216,460,"a smile, to show you, when this deep"
6217,460,"all waded—we look back for play,"
6218,460,"at those old times—in calvary,"
6219,460,"forgive me, if the grave come slow—"
6220,460,for coveting to look at thee—
6221,460,"forgive me, if to stroke thy frost"
6222,460,outvisions paradise!
6223,461,if i should cease to bring a rose
6224,461,"upon a festal day,"
6225,461,'twill be because beyond the rose
6226,461,i have been called away—
6227,461,if i should cease to take the names
6228,461,my buds commemorate—
6229,461,'twill be because death's finger
6230,461,claps my murmuring lip!
6231,462,"if i should die,"
6232,462,and you should live—
6233,462,and time should gurgle on—
6234,462,and morn should beam—
6235,462,and noon should burn—
6236,462,as it has usual done—
6237,462,if birds should build as early
6238,462,and bees as bustling go—
6239,462,one might depart at option
6240,462,from enterprise below!
6241,462,'tis sweet to know that stocks will stand
6242,462,when we with daisies lie—
6243,462,that commerce will continue—
6244,462,and trades as briskly fly—
6245,462,it makes the parting tranquil
6246,462,and keeps the soul serene—
6247,462,that gentlemen so sprightly
6248,462,conduct the pleasing scene!
6249,463,if i shouldn't be alive
6250,463,"when the robins come,"
6251,463,"give the one in red cravat,"
6252,463,a memorial crumb.
6253,463,"if i couldn't thank you,"
6254,463,"being fast asleep,"
6255,463,you will know i'm trying
6256,463,why my granite lip!
6257,464,if i'm lost—now
6258,464,that i was found—
6259,464,shall still my transport be—
6260,464,that once—on me—those jasper gates
6261,464,blazed open—suddenly—
6262,464,that in my awkward—gazing—face—
6263,464,the angels—softly peered—
6264,464,"and touched me with their fleeces,"
6265,464,almost as if they cared—
6266,464,i'm banished—now—you know it—
6267,464,how foreign that can be—
6268,464,you'll know—sir—when the savior's face
6269,464,turns so—away from you—
6270,465,if it had no pencil
6271,465,would it try mine—
6272,465,"worn—now—and dull—sweet,"
6273,465,writing much to thee.
6274,465,"if it had no word,"
6275,465,"would it make the daisy,"
6276,465,"most as big as i was,"
6277,465,when it plucked me?
6278,466,if pain for peace prepares
6279,466,"lo, what ""augustan"" years"
6280,466,our feet await!
6281,466,"if springs from winter rise,"
6282,466,can the anemones
6283,466,be reckoned up?
6284,466,if night stands fast—then noon
6285,466,"to gird us for the sun,"
6286,466,what gaze!
6287,466,when from a thousand skies
6288,466,on our developed eyes
6289,466,noons blaze!
6290,467,"if recollecting were forgetting,"
6291,467,then i remember not.
6292,467,"and if forgetting, recollecting,"
6293,467,how near i had forgot.
6294,467,"and if to miss, were merry,"
6295,467,"and to mourn, were gay,"
6296,467,how very blithe the fingers
6297,467,"that gathered this, today!"
6298,468,if she had been the mistletoe
6299,468,and i had been the rose—
6300,468,how gay upon your table
6301,468,my velvet life to close—
6302,468,"since i am of the druid,"
6303,468,and she is of the dew—
6304,468,i'll deck tradition's buttonhole—
6305,468,and send the rose to you.
6306,469,"if the foolish, call them ""flowers""—"
6307,469,"need the wiser, tell?"
6308,469,"if the savants ""classify"" them"
6309,469,it is just as well!
6310,469,"those who read the ""revelations"""
6311,469,must not criticize
6312,469,those who read the same edition—
6313,469,with beclouded eyes!
6314,469,"could we stand with that old ""moses""—"
6315,469,"""canaan"" denied—"
6316,469,"scan like him, the stately landscape"
6317,469,on the other side—
6318,469,"doubtless, we should deem superfluous"
6319,469,"many sciences,"
6320,469,not pursued by learned angels
6321,469,in scholastic skies!
6322,469,low amid that glad belles lettres
6323,469,"grant that we may stand,"
6324,469,"stars, amid profound galaxies—"
6325,469,"at that grand ""right hand""!"
6326,470,"if this is ""fading"""
6327,470,"oh let me immediately ""fade""!"
6328,470,"if this is ""dying"""
6329,470,"bury me, in such a shroud of red!"
6330,470,"if this is ""sleep,"""
6331,470,on such a night
6332,470,how proud to shut the eye!
6333,470,"good evening, gentle fellow men!"
6334,470,peacock presumes to die!
6335,471,if those i loved were lost
6336,471,the crier's voice would tell me—
6337,471,if those i loved were found
6338,471,the bells of ghent would ring—
6339,471,did those i loved repose
6340,471,the daisy would impel me.
6341,471,philip—when bewildered
6342,471,bore his riddle in!
6343,472,if what we could—were what we would—
6344,472,criterion—be small—
6345,472,it is the ultimate of talk—
6346,472,the impotence to tell—
6347,473,"if you were coming in the fall,"
6348,473,i'd brush the summer by
6349,473,"with half a smile and half a spum,"
6350,473,as housewives do a fly.
6351,473,"if i could see you in a year,"
6352,473,"i'd wind the months in balls,"
6353,473,"and put them each in separate drawers,"
6354,473,until their time befalls.
6355,473,"if only centuries delayed,"
6356,473,"i'd count them on my hand,"
6357,473,subtracting till my fingers dropped
6358,473,into van diemen's land.
6359,473,"if certain, when this life was out,"
6360,473,"that yours and mine should be,"
6361,473,"i'd toss it yonder like a rind,"
6362,473,and taste eternity.
6363,473,"but now, all ignorant of the length"
6364,473,"of time's uncertain wing,"
6365,473,"it goads me, like the goblin bee,"
6366,473,that will not state its sting.
6367,474,"if your nerve, deny you—"
6368,474,go above your nerve—
6369,474,"he can lean against the grave,"
6370,474,if he fear to swerve—
6371,474,that's a steady posture—
6372,474,never any bend
6373,474,held of those brass arms—
6374,474,best giant made—
6375,474,if your soul seesaw—
6376,474,lift the flesh door—
6377,474,the poltroon wants oxygen—
6378,474,nothing more—
6379,475,"impossibility, like wine"
6380,475,exhilarates the man
6381,475,who tastes it; possibility
6382,475,is flavorless—combine
6383,475,a chance's faintest tincture
6384,475,and in the former dram
6385,475,enchantment makes ingredient
6386,475,as certainly as doom—
6387,476,"in ebon box, when years have flown"
6388,476,"to reverently peer,"
6389,476,wiping away the velvet dust
6390,476,summers have sprinkled there!
6391,476,to hold a letter to the light—
6392,476,"grown tawny now, with time—"
6393,476,to con the faded syllables
6394,476,that quickened us like wine!
6395,476,perhaps a flower's shrivelled check
6396,476,among its stores to find—
6397,476,"plucked far away, some morning—"
6398,476,by gallant—mouldering hand!
6399,476,"a curl, perhaps, from foreheads"
6400,476,our constancy forgot—
6401,476,"perhaps, an antique trinket—"
6402,476,in vanished fashions set!
6403,476,and then to lay them quiet back—
6404,476,and go about its care—
6405,476,as if the little ebon box
6406,476,were none of our affair!
6407,477,in falling timbers buried—
6408,477,there breathed a man—
6409,477,outside—the spades—were plying—
6410,477,the lungs—within—
6411,477,could he—know—they sought him—
6412,477,could they—know—he breathed—
6413,477,horrid sand partition—
6414,477,neither—could be heard—
6415,477,never slacked the diggers—
6416,477,but when spades had done—
6417,477,"oh, reward of anguish,"
6418,477,it was dying—then—
6419,477,many things—are fruitless—
6420,477,'tis a baffling earth—
6421,477,but there is no gratitude
6422,477,like the grace—of death—
6423,478,in lands i never saw—they say
6424,478,immortal alps look down—
6425,478,whose bonnets touch the firmament—
6426,478,whose sandals touch the town—
6427,478,meek at whose everlasting feet
6428,478,a myriad daisy play—
6429,478,"which, sir, are you and which am i"
6430,478,upon an august day?
6431,479,in rags mysterious as these
6432,479,the shining courtiers go—
6433,479,"veiling the purple, and the plumes—"
6434,479,veiling the ermine so.
6435,479,"smiling, as they request an alms—"
6436,479,at some imposing door!
6437,479,smiling when we walk barefoot
6438,479,upon their golden floor!
6439,480,in winter in my room
6440,480,i came upon a worm—
6441,480,"pink, lank and warm—"
6442,480,but as he was a worm
6443,480,and worms presume
6444,480,not quite with him at home—
6445,480,secured him by a string
6446,480,to something neighboring
6447,480,and went along.
6448,480,a trifle afterward
6449,480,a thing occurred
6450,480,i'd not believe it if i heard
6451,480,but state with creeping blood—
6452,480,a snake with mottles rare
6453,480,surveyed my chamber floor
6454,480,in feature as the worm before
6455,480,but ringed with power—
6456,480,the very string with which
6457,480,i tied him—too
6458,480,when he was mean and new
6459,480,that string was there—
6460,480,"i shrank—""how fair you are""!"
6461,480,propitiation's claw—
6462,480,"""afraid,"" he hissed"
6463,480,"""of me""?"
6464,480,"""no cordiality""—"
6465,480,he fathomed me—
6466,480,then to a rhythm slim
6467,480,secreted in his form
6468,480,as patterns swim
6469,480,projected him.
6470,480,that time i flew
6471,480,both eyes his way
6472,480,lest he pursue
6473,480,nor ever ceased to run
6474,480,till in a distant town
6475,480,towns on from mine
6476,480,i set me down
6477,480,this was a dream.
6478,481,inconceivably solemn!
6479,481,things go gay
6480,481,pierce—by the very press
6481,481,of imagery—
6482,481,their far parades—order on the eye
6483,481,with a mute pomp—
6484,481,a pleading pageantry—
6485,481,"flags, are a brave sight—"
6486,481,but no true eye
6487,481,ever went by one—
6488,481,steadily—
6489,481,music's triumphant—
6490,481,but the fine ear
6491,481,winces with delight
6492,481,are drums too near—
6493,482,"is bliss then, such abyss,"
6494,482,i must not put my foot amiss
6495,482,for fear i spoil my shoe?
6496,482,i'd rather suit my foot
6497,482,than save my boot—
6498,482,for yet to buy another pair
6499,482,"is possible,"
6500,482,at any store—
6501,482,"but bliss, is sold just once."
6502,482,the patent lost
6503,482,none buy it any more—
6504,482,"say, foot, decide the point—"
6505,482,"the lady cross, or not?"
6506,482,verdict for boot!
6507,483,is it dead—find it—
6508,483,out of sound—out of sight—
6509,483,"""happy""? which is wiser—"
6510,483,"you, or the wind?"
6511,483,"""conscious""? won't you ask that—"
6512,483,of the low ground?
6513,483,"""homesick""? many met it—"
6514,483,even through them—this
6515,483,cannot testify—
6516,483,themself—as dumb—
6517,484,"is it true, dear sue?"
6518,484,are there two?
6519,484,i shouldn't like to come
6520,484,for fear of joggling him!
6521,484,if i could shut him up
6522,484,"in a coffee cup,"
6523,484,or tie him to a pin
6524,484,till i got in—
6525,484,or make him fast
6526,484,"to ""toby's"" fist—"
6527,484,hist! whist! i'd come!
6528,485,"it bloomed and dropt, a single noon—"
6529,485,the flower—distinct and red—
6530,485,"i, passing, thought another noon"
6531,485,another in its stead
6532,485,"will equal glow, and thought no more"
6533,485,but came another day
6534,485,to find the species disappeared—
6535,485,the same locality—
6536,485,the sun in place—no other fraud
6537,485,on nature's perfect sum—
6538,485,had i but lingered yesterday—
6539,485,was my retrieveless blame—
6540,485,much flowers of this and further zones
6541,485,have perished in my hands
6542,485,for seeking its resemblance—
6543,485,but unapproached it stands—
6544,485,the single flower of the earth
6545,485,"that i, in passing by"
6546,485,unconscious was—great nature's face
6547,485,passed infinite by me—
6548,486,"it can't be ""summer""!"
6549,486,that—got through!
6550,486,"it's early—yet—for ""spring""!"
6551,486,there's that long town of white—to cross—
6552,486,before the blackbirds sing!
6553,486,"it can't be ""dying""!"
6554,486,it's too rouge—
6555,486,the dead shall go in white—
6556,486,so sunset shuts my question down
6557,486,with cuffs of chrysolite!
6558,487,"it ceased to hurt me, though so slow"
6559,487,i could not feel the anguish go—
6560,487,but only knew by looking back—
6561,487,that something—had benumbed the track—
6562,487,"nor when it altered, i could say,"
6563,487,"for i had worn it, every day,"
6564,487,as constant as the childish frock—
6565,487,"i hung upon the peg, at night."
6566,487,but not the grief—that nestled close
6567,487,as needles—ladies softly press
6568,487,to cushions cheeks—
6569,487,to keep their place—
6570,487,"nor what consoled it, i could trace—"
6571,487,"except, whereas 'twas wilderness—"
6572,487,it's better—almost peace—
6573,488,it did not surprise me—
6574,488,so i said—or thought—
6575,488,she will stir her pinions
6576,488,"and the nest forgot,"
6577,488,traverse broader forests—
6578,488,"build in gayer boughs,"
6579,488,breathe in ear more modern
6580,488,god's old fashioned vows—
6581,488,this was but a birdling—
6582,488,what and if it be
6583,488,one within my bosom
6584,488,had departed me?
6585,488,this was but a story—
6586,488,what and if indeed
6587,488,there were just such coffin
6588,488,in the heart instead?
6589,489,it don't sound so terrible—quite—as it did—
6590,489,"i run it over—""dead"", brain, ""dead."""
6591,489,put it in latin—left of my school—
6592,489,seems it don't shriek so—under rule.
6593,489,"turn it, a little—full in the face"
6594,489,a trouble looks bitterest—
6595,489,shift it—just—
6596,489,"say ""when tomorrow comes this way—"
6597,489,"i shall have waded down one day."""
6598,489,i suppose it will interrupt me some
6599,489,till i get accustomed—but then the tomb
6600,489,like other new things—shows largest—then—
6601,489,"and smaller, by habit—"
6602,489,it's shrewder then
6603,489,put the thought in advance—a year—
6604,489,"how like ""a fit""—then—"
6605,489,murder—wear!
6606,490,it dropped so low   in my regard  
6607,490,i heard it hit the ground  
6608,490,and go to pieces on the stones
6609,490,at bottom of my mind  
6610,490,yet blamed the fate that flung it   less
6611,490,"than i denounced myself,"
6612,490,for entertaining plated wares
6613,490,upon my silver shelf  
6614,491,it feels a shame to be alive—
6615,491,when men so brave—are dead—
6616,491,one envies the distinguished dust—
6617,491,permitted—such a head—
6618,491,the stone—that tells defending whom
6619,491,this spartan put away
6620,491,what little of him we—possessed
6621,491,in pawn for liberty—
6622,491,the price is great—sublimely paid—
6623,491,do we deserve—a thing—
6624,491,that lives—like dollars—must be piled
6625,491,before we may obtain?
6626,491,are we that wait—sufficient worth—
6627,491,that such enormous pearl
6628,491,as life—dissolved be—for us—
6629,491,in battle's—horrid bowl?
6630,491,it may be—a renown to live—
6631,491,i think the man who die—
6632,491,those unsustained—saviors—
6633,491,present divinity—
6634,492,it is a lonesome glee—
6635,492,yet sanctifies the mind—
6636,492,with fair association—
6637,492,afar upon the wind
6638,492,a bird to overhear
6639,492,delight without a cause—
6640,492,arrestless as invisible—
6641,492,a matter of the skies.
6642,493,"it is an honorable thought,"
6643,493,"  and makes one lift one's hat,"
6644,493,as one encountered gentlefolk
6645,493,"  upon a daily street,"
6646,493,"that we've immortal place,"
6647,493,"  though pyramids decay,"
6648,493,"and kingdoms, like the orchard,"
6649,493,  flit russetly away.
6650,494,it is easy to work when the soul is at play—
6651,494,but when the soul is in pain—
6652,494,the hearing him put his playthings up
6653,494,makes work difficult—then—
6654,494,"it is simple, to ache in the bone, or the rind—"
6655,494,but gimlets—among the nerve—
6656,494,mangle daintier—terribler—
6657,494,like a panter in the glove—
6658,495,"it knew no lapse, nor diminuation—"
6659,495,but large—serene—
6660,495,burned on—until through dissolution—
6661,495,it failed from men—
6662,495,i could not deem these planetary forces
6663,495,annulled—
6664,495,but suffered an exchange of territory—
6665,495,or world—
6666,496,it knew no medicine—
6667,496,it was not sickness—then—
6668,496,nor any need of surgery—
6669,496,and therefore—'twas not pain—
6670,496,it moved away the cheeks—
6671,496,a dimple at a time—
6672,496,and left the profile—plainer—
6673,496,and in the place of bloom
6674,496,it left the little tint
6675,496,that never had a name—
6676,496,you've seen it on a cast's face—
6677,496,was paradise—to blame—
6678,496,if momently ajar—
6679,496,temerity—drew near—
6680,496,and sickened—ever afterward
6681,496,for somewhat that it saw?
6682,497,it makes no difference abroad—
6683,497,the seasons—fit—the same—
6684,497,the mornings blossom into noons—
6685,497,and split their pods of flame—
6686,497,wild flowers—kindle in the woods—
6687,497,the brooks slam—all the day—
6688,497,no black bird bates his banjo—
6689,497,for passing calvary—
6690,497,auto da fe—and judgment—
6691,497,are nothing to the bee—
6692,497,his separation from his rose—
6693,497,to him—sums misery—
6694,498,it might be lonelier
6695,498,without the loneliness—
6696,498,i'm so accustomed to my fate—
6697,498,perhaps the other—peace—
6698,498,would interrupt the dark—
6699,498,and crowd the little room—
6700,498,too scant—by cubits—to contain
6701,498,the sacrament—of him—
6702,498,i am not used to hope—
6703,498,it might intrude upon—
6704,498,its sweet parade—blaspheme the place—
6705,498,ordained to suffering—
6706,498,it might be easier
6707,498,to fail—with land in sight—
6708,498,than gain—my blue peninsula—
6709,498,to perish—of delight—
6710,499,it sifts from leaden sieves—
6711,499,it powders all the wood.
6712,499,it fills with alabaster wool
6713,499,the wrinkles of the road—
6714,499,it makes an even face
6715,499,"of mountain, and of plain—"
6716,499,unbroken forehead from the east
6717,499,unto the east again—
6718,499,it reaches to the fence—
6719,499,it wraps it rail by rail
6720,499,till it is lost in fleeces—
6721,499,it deals celestial vail
6722,499,"to stump, and stack—and stem—"
6723,499,a summer's empty room—
6724,499,"acres of joints, where harvests were,"
6725,499,"recordless, but for them "
6726,499,it ruffles wrists of posts
6727,499,as ankles of a queen—
6728,499,then stills its artisans—like ghosts—
6729,499,denying they have been—
6730,500,it struck me—every day—
6731,500,the lightning was as new
6732,500,as if the cloud that instant slit
6733,500,and let the fire through—
6734,500,it burned me—in the night—
6735,500,it blistered to my dream—
6736,500,it sickened fresh upon my sight—
6737,500,with every morn that came—
6738,500,i though that storm—was brief—
6739,500,the maddest—quickest by—
6740,500,but nature lost the date of this—
6741,500,and left it in the sky—
6742,501,it tossed—and tossed—
6743,501,a little brig i knew—o'ertook by blast—
6744,501,it spun—and spun—
6745,501,"and groped delirious, for morn—"
6746,501,it slipped—and slipped—
6747,501,as one that drunken—stept—
6748,501,its white foot tripped—
6749,501,then dropped from sight—
6750,501,"ah, brig—good night"
6751,501,to crew and you—
6752,501,the ocean's heart too smooth—too blue—
6753,501,to break for you—
6754,502,it troubled me as once i was—
6755,502,for i was once a child—
6756,502,concluding how an atom—fell—
6757,502,and yet the heavens—held—
6758,502,the heavens weighed the most—by far—
6759,502,yet blue—and solid—stood—
6760,502,without a bolt—that i could prove—
6761,502,would giants—understand?
6762,502,life set me larger—problems—
6763,502,some i shall keep—to solve
6764,502,till algebra is easier—
6765,502,or simpler proved—above—
6766,502,then—too—be comprehended—
6767,502,what sorer—puzzled me—
6768,502,why heaven did not break away—
6769,502,and tumble—blue—on me—
6770,503,"it was a grave, yet bore no stone"
6771,503,enclosed 'twas not of rail
6772,503,"a consciousness its acre, and"
6773,503,it held a human soul.
6774,503,"entombed by whom, for what offence"
6775,503,if home or foreign born—
6776,503,had i the curiosity
6777,503,'twere not appeased of men
6778,503,"till resurrection, i must guess"
6779,503,denied the small desire
6780,503,a rose upon its ridge to sow
6781,503,or take away a briar.
6782,504,it was given to me by the gods—
6783,504,when i was a little girl—
6784,504,they given us presents most—you know—
6785,504,when we are new—and small.
6786,504,i kept it in my hand—
6787,504,i never put it down—
6788,504,i did not dare to eat—or sleep—
6789,504,for fear it would be gone—
6790,504,"i heard such words as ""rich""—"
6791,504,when hurrying to school—
6792,504,from lips at corners of the streets—
6793,504,and wrestled with a smile.
6794,504,rich! 'twas myself—was rich—
6795,504,to take the name of gold—
6796,504,and gold to own—in solid bars—
6797,504,the difference—made me bold—
6798,505,"it was not death, for i stood up,"
6799,505,and all the dead lie down.
6800,505,"it was not night, for all the bells"
6801,505,put out their tongues for noon.
6802,505,"it was not frost, for on my flesh"
6803,505,"i felt siroccos crawl,"
6804,505,"nor fire, for just my marble feet"
6805,505,could keep a chancel cool.
6806,505,"and yet it tasted like them all,"
6807,505,the figures i have seen
6808,505,set orderly for burial
6809,505,"reminded me of mine,"
6810,505,as if my life were shaven
6811,505,and fitted to a frame
6812,505,"and could not breathe without a key,"
6813,505,"and 'twas like midnight, some,"
6814,505,when everything that ticked has stopped
6815,505,"and space stares all around,"
6816,505,"or grisly frosts, first autumn morns,"
6817,505,repeal the beating ground;
6818,505,"but most like chaos, stopless, cool,"
6819,505,"without a chance, or spar,"
6820,505,or even a report of land
6821,505,to justify despair.
6822,506,it was too late for man—
6823,506,"but early, yet, for god—"
6824,506,creation—impotent to help—
6825,506,but prayer—remained—our side—
6826,506,how excellent the heaven—
6827,506,when earth—cannot be had—
6828,506,how hospitable—then—the face
6829,506,of our old neighbor—god—
6830,507,it will be summer—eventually.
6831,507,ladies—with parasols—
6832,507,sauntering gentlemen—with canes—
6833,507,and little girls—with dolls—
6834,507,will tint the pallid landscape—
6835,507,as 'twere a bright bouquet—
6836,507,"thro' drifted deep, in parian—"
6837,507,the village lies—today—
6838,507,the lilacs—bending many a year—
6839,507,will sway with purple load—
6840,507,the bees—will not despise the tune—
6841,507,their forefathers—have hummed—
6842,507,the wild rose—redden in the bog—
6843,507,the aster—on the hill
6844,507,her everlasting fashion—set—
6845,507,and covenant gentians—frill—
6846,507,till summer folds her miracle—
6847,507,as women—do—their gown—
6848,507,of priests—adjust the symbols—
6849,507,when sacrament—is done—
6850,508,it would have starved a gnat—
6851,508,to live so small as i—
6852,508,and yet i was a living child—
6853,508,with food's necessity
6854,508,upon me—like a claw—
6855,508,i could no more remove
6856,508,than i could coax a leech away—
6857,508,or make a dragon—move—
6858,508,not like the gnat—had i—
6859,508,the privilege to fly
6860,508,and seek a dinner for myself—
6861,508,how mightier he—than i—
6862,508,nor like himself—the art
6863,508,upon the window pane
6864,508,to gad my little being out—
6865,508,and not begin—again—
6866,509,it would never be common—more—i said—
6867,509,difference—had begun—
6868,509,many a bitterness—had been—
6869,509,but that old sort—was done—
6870,509,or—if it sometime—showed—as 'twill—
6871,509,upon the downiest—morn—
6872,509,such bliss—had i—for all the years—
6873,509,'twould give an easier—pain—
6874,509,i'd so much joy—i told it—red—
6875,509,upon my simple cheek—
6876,509,i felt it publish—in my eye—
6877,509,'twas needless—any speak—
6878,509,i walked—as wings—my body bore—
6879,509,the feet—i former used—
6880,509,unnecessary—now to me—
6881,509,as boots—would be—to birds—
6882,509,i put my pleasure all abroad—
6883,509,i dealth a word of gold
6884,509,to every creature—that i met—
6885,509,and dowered—all the world—
6886,509,when—suddenly—my riches shrank—
6887,509,a goblin—drank my dew—
6888,509,my palaces—dropped tenantless—
6889,509,myself—was beggared—too—
6890,509,i clutched at sounds—
6891,509,i groped at shapes—
6892,509,i touched the tops of films—
6893,509,i felt the wilderness roll back
6894,509,along my golden lines—
6895,509,the sackcloth—hangs upon the nail—
6896,509,the frock i used to wear—
6897,509,but where my moment of brocade—
6898,509,my—drop—of india?
6899,510,"it's all i have to bring to-day,"
6900,510,"  this, and my heart beside,"
6901,510,"this, and my heart, and all the fields,"
6902,510,  and all the meadows wide.
6903,510,"be sure you count, should i forget,  "
6904,510,"  some one the sum could tell,  "
6905,510,"this, and my heart, and all the bees"
6906,510, which in the clover dwell.
6907,511,it's all i have to bring today—
6908,511,"this, and my heart beside—"
6909,511,"this, and my heart, and all the fields—"
6910,511,and all the meadows wide—
6911,511,be sure you count—should i forget
6912,511,some one the sum could tell—
6913,511,"this, and my heart, and all the bees"
6914,511,which in the clover dwell.
6915,512,it's coming—the postponeless creature—
6916,512,it gains the block—and now—it gains the door—
6917,512,"chooses its latch, from all the other fastenings—"
6918,512,"enters—with a ""you know me—sir""?"
6919,512,simple salute—and certain recognition—
6920,512,bold—were it enemy—brief—were it friend—
6921,512,"dresses each house in crape, and icicle—"
6922,512,and carries one—out of it—to god—
6923,513,it's easy to invent a life—
6924,513,god does it—every day—
6925,513,creation—but the gambol
6926,513,of his authority—
6927,513,it's easy to efface it—
6928,513,the thrifty deity
6929,513,could scarce afford eternity
6930,513,to spontaneity—
6931,513,the perished patterns murmur—
6932,513,but his perturbless plan
6933,513,proceed—inserting here—a sun—
6934,513,there—leaving out a man—
6935,514,"it's like the light,  "
6936,514,  a fashionless delight
6937,514,"it's like the bee,  "
6938,514,  a dateless melody.
6939,514,"it's like the woods,"
6940,514,"  private like breeze,"
6941,514,"phraseless, yet it stirs"
6942,514,  the proudest trees.
6943,514,"it's like the morning,  "
6944,514,"  best when it's done,  "
6945,514,the everlasting clocks
6946,514,  chime noon.
6947,515,it's such a little thing to weep—
6948,515,so short a thing to sigh—
6949,515,and yet—by trades—the size of these
6950,515,we men and women die!
6951,516,it's thoughts—and just one heart—
6952,516,and old sunshine—about—
6953,516,make frugal—ones—content—
6954,516,and two or three—for company—
6955,516,upon a holiday—
6956,516,crowded—as sacrament—
6957,516,books—when the unit—
6958,516,spare the tenant—long eno'—
6959,516,a picture—if it care—
6960,516,itself—a gallery too rare—
6961,516,for needing more—
6962,516,flowers—to keep the eyes—from going awkward—
6963,516,when it snows—
6964,516,a bird—if they—prefer—
6965,516,though winter fire—sing clear as plover—
6966,516,to our—ear—
6967,516,a landscape—not so great
6968,516,to suffocate the eye—
6969,516,a hill—perhaps—
6970,516,perhaps—the profile of a mill
6971,516,turned by the wind—
6972,516,tho' such—are luxuries—
6973,516,it's thoughts—and just two heart—
6974,516,and heaven—about—
6975,516,at least—a counterfeit—
6976,516,we would not have correct—
6977,516,and immortality—can be almost—
6978,516,not quite—content—
6979,517,jesus! thy crucifix
6980,517,enable thee to guess
6981,517,the smaller size!
6982,517,jesus! thy second face
6983,517,mind thee in paradise
6984,517,of ours!
6985,518,joy to have merited the pain—
6986,518,to merit the release—
6987,518,joy to have perished every step—
6988,518,to compass paradise—
6989,518,pardon—to look upon thy face—
6990,518,with these old fashioned eyes—
6991,518,better than new—could be—for that—
6992,518,though bought in paradise—
6993,518,because they looked on thee before—
6994,518,and thou hast looked on them—
6995,518,prove me—my hazel witnesses
6996,518,the features are the same—
6997,518,"so fleet thou wert, when present—"
6998,518,so infinite—when gone—
6999,518,an orient's apparition—
7000,518,remanded of the morn—
7001,518,the height i recollect—
7002,518,'twas even with the hills—
7003,518,the depth upon my soul was notched—
7004,518,as floods—on whites of wheels—
7005,518,to haunt—till time have dropped
7006,518,"his last decade away,"
7007,518,and haunting actualize—to last
7008,518,at least—eternity—
7009,519,just as he spoke it from his hands
7010,519,this edifice remain—
7011,519,"a turret more, a turret less"
7012,519,dishonor his design—
7013,519,according as his skill prefer
7014,519,"it perish, or endure—"
7015,519,"content, soe'er, it ornament"
7016,519,his absent character.
7017,520,"just lost, when i was saved!"
7018,520,just felt the world go by!
7019,520,"just girt me for the onset with eternity,"
7020,520,"when breath blew back,"
7021,520,and on the other side
7022,520,i heard recede the disappointed tide!
7023,520,"therefore, as one returned, i feel"
7024,520,odd secrets of the line to tell!
7025,520,"some sailor, skirting foreign shores—"
7026,520,"some pale reporter, from the awful doors"
7027,520,before the seal!
7028,520,"next time, to stay!"
7029,520,"next time, the things to see"
7030,520,"by ear unheard,"
7031,520,unscrutinized by eye—
7032,520,"next time, to tarry,"
7033,520,while the ages steal—
7034,520,"slow tramp the centuries,"
7035,520,and the cycles wheel!
7036,521,just so—jesus—raps—
7037,521,he—doesn't weary—
7038,521,last—at the knocker—
7039,521,and first—at the bell.
7040,521,then—on divinest tiptoe—standing—
7041,521,might he but spy the lady's soul—
7042,521,when he—retires—
7043,521,chilled—or weary—
7044,521,it will be ample time for—me—
7045,521,patient—upon the steps—until then—
7046,521,hears! i am knocking—low at thee.
7047,522,kill your balm—and its odors bless you—
7048,522,bare your jessamine—to the storm—
7049,522,and she will fling her maddest perfume—
7050,522,haply—your summer night to charm—
7051,522,stab the bird—that built in your bosom—
7052,522,"oh, could you catch her last refrain—"
7053,522,"bubble! ""forgive""—""some better""—bubble!"
7054,522,"""carol for him—when i am gone""!"
7055,523,knows how to forget!
7056,523,but could it teach it?
7057,523,"easiest of arts, they say"
