414,22,and track me beyond the cerulean foam of the deep?
415,22,would you tear from my lintels these sacred green garlands of leaves?
416,22,"would you scare the white, nested, wild pigeons of joy from my eaves?"
417,22,would you touch and defile with dead fingers the robes of my priest?
418,22,would you weave your dim moan with the chantings of love at my feast?
419,22,"go back to your grave, o my dream, under forests of snow,"
420,22,"where a heart-riven child hid you once, seven eons ago."
421,22,who bade you arise from your darkness? i bid you depart!
422,22,profane not the shrines i have raised in the clefts of my heart.
423,23,"see how the speckled sky burns like a pigeon's throat,"
424,23,jewelled with embers of opal and peridote.
425,23,"see the white river that flashes and scintillates,"
426,23,curved like a tusk from the mouth of the city-gates.
427,23,"hark, from the minaret, how the muezzin's call"
428,23,floats like a battle-flag over the city wall.
429,23,"from trellised balconies, languid and luminous"
430,23,"faces gleam, veiled in a splendour voluminous."
431,23,"leisurely elephants wind through the winding lanes,"
432,23,swinging their silver bells hung from their silver chains.
433,23,round the high char minar sounds of gay cavalcades
434,23,blend with the music of cymbals and serenades.
435,23,"over the city bridge night comes majestical,"
436,23,borne like a queen to a sumptuous festival.
