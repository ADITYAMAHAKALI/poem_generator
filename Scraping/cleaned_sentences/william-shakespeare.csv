384,3,"heigh-ho! sing, heigh-ho! unto the green holly,"
385,3,"most freindship if feigning, most loving mere folly,"
386,3,"then heigh-ho, the holly!"
387,3,this life is most jolly.
388,4,"roses, their sharp spines being gone,"
389,4,"not royal in their smells alone,"
390,4,   but in their hue;
391,4,"maiden pinks, of odour faint,"
392,4,"daisies smell-less, yet most quaint,"
393,4,   and sweet thyme true;
394,4,"primrose, firstborn child of ver;"
395,4,"merry springtime's harbinger,"
396,4,   with her bells dim;
397,4,"oxlips in their cradles growing,"

399,4,   larks'-heels trim;
400,4,all dear nature's children sweet

410,4,"or with them any discord bring,"
411,4,   but from it fly!
412,5,"o mistress mine, where are you roaming?"
413,5,o stay and hear! your true-love's coming
414,5,that can sing both high and low;
415,5,"trip no further, pretty sweeting,"
416,5,journey's end in lovers' meeting 
417,5,every wise man's son doth know.
418,5,what is love? 'tis not hereafter;
419,5,present mirth hath present laughter;
420,5,"what's to come is still unsure,"
421,5,"in delay there lies no plenty, "
422,5,"then come kiss me, sweet and twenty,"
423,5,youth's a stuff will not endure.
424,6,"come away, come away, death,"
425,6,   and in sad cypres let me be laid;
426,6,"fly away, fly away, breath;"
427,6,   i am slain by a fair cruel maid.
428,6,"my shroud of white, stuck all with yew,"
429,6,   o prepare it!
430,6,"my part of death, no one so true"
431,6,   did share it.
432,6,"not a flower, not a flower sweet,"
433,6,   on my black coffin let there be strown;
434,6,"not a friend, not a friend greet"
435,6,"   my poor corse, where my bones shall be thrown,"
436,6,"a thousand thousand sighs to save,"
437,6,"   lay me, o, where"
438,6,sad true lover never find my grave
439,6,   to weep there!
440,7,urns and odours bring away!
441,7,"   vapours, sighs, darken the day!"
442,7,our dole more deadly looks than dying;
443,7,"   balms and gums and heavy cheers,"
444,7,"   sacred vials fill'd with tears,"
445,7,and clamours through the wild air flying!
446,7,"   come, all sad and solemn shows,"
447,7,   that are quick-eyed pleasure's foes!
448,7,   we convent naught else but woes.
449,8,"over hill, over dale,"
450,8,"   thorough bush, thorough brier,"
451,8,"   over park, over pale,"
452,8,"   thorough flood, thorough fire,"
453,8,"   i do wander everywhere,"
454,8,   swifter than the moone's sphere;
455,8,"   and i serve the fairy queen,"
456,8,"   to dew her orbs upon the green,"
457,8,   the cowslips tall her pensioners be;
458,8,   in their gold coats spots you see;
459,8,"   those be rubies, fairy favours,"
460,8,"   in those freckles live their savours,"
461,8,"   i must go seek some dew-drops here,"
462,8,and hang a pearl in every cowslip's ear.

469,9,"   lulla, lulla, lullaby; lulla, lulla, lullaby!"
470,9,"   never harm,"
471,9,"   nor spell nor charm,"
472,9,   come our lovely lady nigh;
473,9,"   so, good night, with lullaby."
474,9,"weaving spiders, come not here;"
475,9,"   hence, you long-legg'd spinners, hence!"
476,9,"beetles black, approach not near;"
477,9,"   worm nor snail, do no offence."
478,9,"   philomel, with melody,"
479,9,   sing in our sweet lullaby;
480,9,"   lulla, lulla, lullaby; lulla, lulla, lullaby!"
481,9,"   never harm,"
482,9,"   nor spell nor charm,"
483,9,   come our lovely lady nigh;
484,9,"   so, good night, with lullaby."
485,10,"come unto these yellow sands,"
486,10,"   and then take hands,"
487,10,"court'sied when you have, and kiss'd, "
488,10,"   the wild waves whist, "
489,10,foot it featly here and there;
490,10,"and, sweet sprites, the burthen bear."
491,10,"   hark, hark!"
492,10,"   bow, wow,"
493,10,"   the watch-dogs bark,"
494,10,"   bow, wow."
495,10,"   hark, hark! i hear"
496,10,   the strain of strutting chanticleer
497,10,"   cry, cock-a-diddle-dow!"
498,11,"where the bee sucks, there suck i,"
499,11,in a cowslip's bell i lie;
500,11,there i couch when owls do cry.
501,11,on the bat's back i do fly
502,11,"after summer merrily,"
503,11,"   merrily, merrily, shall i live now,"
504,11,   under the blossom that hangs on the bough.
505,12,full fathom five thy father lies;
506,12,of his bones are coral made;
507,12,"those are pearls that were his eyes,"
508,12,"   nothing of him that doth fade,"
509,12,but doth suffer a sea-change
510,12,into something rich and strange.
511,12,"sea-nymphs hourly ring his knell,"
512,12,   ding-dong.
513,12,   hark! now i hear them 
514,12,"   ding-dong, bell!"
515,13,"fear no more the heat o' the sun,"
516,13,   nor the furious winter's rages;
517,13,"thou thy worldly task hast done,"
518,13,"   home art gone, and ta'en thy wages,"
519,13,"golden lads and girls all must,"
520,13,"as chimney-sweepers, come to dust."
521,13,"fear no more the frown o' the great,"
522,13,   thou art past the tyrant's stroke;
523,13,care no more to clothe and eat;
524,13,"   to thee the reed is as the oak,"
525,13,"the sceptre, learning, physic, must"
526,13,"all follow this, and come to dust."
527,13,"fear no more the lightning-flash,"
528,13,   nor the all-dreaded thunder-stone;
529,13,"fear not slander, censure rash;"
530,13,"   thou hast finish'd joy and moan,"
531,13,"all lovers young, all lovers must"
532,13,"consign to thee, and come to dust."
533,13,no exorciser harm thee!
534,13,nor no witchcraft charm thee!

536,13,nothing ill come near thee!
537,13,quiet consummation have;
538,13,and renowned be thy grave!
539,14,"but, lo! from forth a copse that neighbours by,"
540,14,"a breeding jennet, lusty, young, and proud,"
541,14,"adonis' trampling courser doth espy,"
542,14,"and forth she rushes, snorts and neighs aloud;"
543,14,"the strong-neck'd steed, being tied unto a tree,"
544,14,"breaketh his rein, and to her straight goes he."
545,14,"imperiously he leaps, he neighs, he bounds,"
546,14,and now his woven girths he breaks asunder;
547,14,"the bearing earth with his hard hoof he wounds,"
548,14,whose hollow womb resounds like heaven's thunder;
549,14,the iron bit he crushes 'tween his teeth
550,14,controlling what he was controlled with.
551,14,his ears up-prick'd; his braided hanging mane
552,14,upon his compass'd crest now stand on end;
553,14,"his nostrils drink the air, and forth again,"
554,14,"as from a furnace, vapours doth he send,"
555,14,"his eye, which scornfully glisters like fire,"
556,14,shows his hot courage and his high desire.
557,14,"sometime her trots, as if he told the steps,"
558,14,with gentle majesty and modest pride;
559,14,"anon he rears upright, curvets and leaps,"
560,14,"as who should say, 'lo! thus my strength is tried;"
561,14,and this i do to captivate the eye
562,14,of the fair breeder that is standing by.'
563,14,"what recketh he his rider's angry stir,"
564,14,"his flattering 'holla,' or his 'stand, i say?'"
565,14,what cares he now for curb of pricking spur?
566,14,for rich caparisons or trapping gay?
567,14,"he sees his love, and nothing else he sees,"
568,14,nor nothing else with his proud sight agrees.
569,14,"look, when a painter would surpass the life,"
570,14,"in limning out a well-proportion'd steed,"
571,14,"his art with nature's workmanship at strife,"
572,14,as if the dead the living should exceed;
573,14,"so did this horse excel a common one,"
574,14,"in shape, in courage, colour, pace and bone"
575,14,"round-hoof'd, short-jointed, fetlocks shag and long,"
576,14,"broad breast, full eye, small head, and nostril wide,"
577,14,"high crest, short ears, straight legs and passing strong,"
578,14,"thin mane, thick tail, broad buttock, tender hide,"
579,14,"look, what a horse should have he did not lack,"
580,14,save a proud rider on so proud a back.
581,14,"sometimes he scuds far off, and there he stares;"
582,14,anon he starts at stirring of a feather;
583,14,"to bid the wind a race he now prepares,"
584,14,and whe'r he run or fly they know not whether;
585,14,"for through his mane and tail the high wind sings,"
586,14,"fanning the hairs, who wave like feather'd wings."
587,14,"he looks upon his love, and neighs unto her;"
588,14,she answers him as if she knew his mind;
589,14,"being proud, as females are, to see him woo her,"
590,14,"she puts on outward strangeness, seems unkind,"
591,14,"spurns at his love and scorns the heat he feels,"
592,14,beating his kind embracements with her heels.
593,14,"then, like a melancholy malcontent,"
594,14,"he vails his tail that, like a falling plume"
595,14,"cool shadow to his melting buttock lent,"
596,14,"he stamps, and bites the poor flies in his fume."
597,14,"his love, perceiving how he is enrag'd,"
598,14,"grew kinder, and his fury was assuag'd."
599,14,his testy master goeth about to take him;
600,14,"when lo! the unback'd breeder, full of fear,"
601,14,"jealous of catching, swiftly doth forsake him,"
602,14,"with her the horse, and left adonis there."
603,14,"as they were mad, unto the wood they hie them,"
604,14,out-stripping crows that strive to over-fly them.
605,14,"i prophesy they death, my living sorrow,"
606,14,if thou encounter with the boar to-morrow.
607,14,"""but if thou needs wilt hunt, be rul'd by me;"
608,14,"uncouple at the timorous flying hare,"
609,14,"or at the fox which lives by subtlety,"
610,14,"or at the roe which no encounter dare,"
611,14,"pursue these fearful creatures o'er the downs,"
612,14,and on they well-breath'd horse keep with they hounds.
613,14,"""and when thou hast on food the purblind hare,"
614,14,"mark the poor wretch, to overshoot his troubles"
615,14,"how he outruns with winds, and with what care"
616,14,"he cranks and crosses with a thousand doubles,"
617,14,the many musits through the which he goes
618,14,are like a labyrinth to amaze his foes.
619,14,"""sometime he runs among a flock of sheep,"
620,14,"to make the cunning hounds mistake their smell,"
621,14,"and sometime where earth-delving conies keep,"
622,14,"to stop the loud pursuers in their yell,"
623,14,and sometime sorteth with a herd of deer;
624,14,"danger deviseth shifts; wit waits on fear,"
625,14,"""for there his smell with other being mingled,"
626,14,"the hot scent-snuffing hounds are driven to doubt,"
627,14,ceasing their clamorous cry till they have singled
628,14,with much ado the cold fault cleanly out;
629,14,"then do they spend their mouths, echo replies,"
630,14,as if another chase were in the skies.
631,14,"""by this, poor wat, far off upon a hill,"
632,14,"stands on his hinder legs with listening ear,"
633,14,"to hearken if his foes pursue him still,"
634,14,anon their loud alarums he doth hear;
635,14,and now his grief may be compared well
636,14,to one sore sick that hears the passing-bell.
637,14,"""then shalt thou see the dew-bedabbled wretch"
638,14,"turn, and return, indenting with the way;"
639,14,"each envious briar his weary legs doth scratch,"
640,14,"each shadow makes him stop, each murmur stay,"
641,14,"for misery is trodden on by many,"
642,14,and being low never reliev'd by any.
643,14,"""lie quietly, and hear a little more;"
644,14,"nay, do not struggle, for thou shalt not rise,"
645,14,"to make thee hate the hunting of the boar,"
646,14,"unlike myself thou hear'st me moralize,"
647,14,"applying this to that, and so to so;"
648,14,"for love can comment upon every woe."""
649,15,"from you have i been absent in the spring,"
650,15,"when proud-pied april, dressed in all his trim,"
651,15,"hath put a spirit of youth in everything,"
652,15,"that heavy saturn laughed and leaped with him,"
653,15,"yet nor the lays of birds, nor the sweet smell"
654,15,"of different flowers in odor and in hue,"
655,15,"could make me any summer's story tell,"
656,15,or from their proud lap pluck them where they grew.
657,15,"nor did i wonder at the lily's white,"
658,15,nor praise the deep vermilion in the rose;
659,15,"they were but sweet, but figures of delight,"
660,15,"drawn after you, you pattern of all those."
661,15,"yet seemed it winter still, and, you away,"
662,15,as with your shadow i with these did play.
663,16,"orpheus with his lute made trees,"
664,16,"    and the mountain tops that freeze,"
665,16,"      bow themselves, when he did sing,"
666,16,    to his music plants and flowers
667,16,    ever sprung; as sun and showers
668,16,      there had made a lasting spring.
669,16,"    everything that heard him play,"
670,16,"    even the billows of the sea,"
671,16,"      hung their heads, and then lay by."
672,16,"  in sweet music is such art,"
673,16,  killing care and grief of heart
674,16,"    fall asleep, or hearing, die."
675,17,"sigh no more, ladies, sigh no more,"
676,17,men were deceivers ever;
677,17,"one foot in sea, and one on shore,"
678,17,to one thing constant never.
679,17,"then sigh not so,"
680,17,"but let them go,"
681,17,"and be you blith and bonny,"
682,17,converting all your sounds of woe
683,17,"into hey nonny, nonny."
684,17,"sing no more ditties, sing no mo"
685,17,of dumps so dull and heavy;
686,17,"the fraud of men was ever so,"
687,17,since summer first was leavy.
688,17,"then sigh not so,"
689,17,"but let them go,"
690,17,"and be you blith and bonny,"
691,17,converting all your sounds of woe
692,17,"into hey nonny, nonny."
693,18,when in the chronicle of wasted time
694,18,"  i see descriptions of the fairest wights,"
695,18,  and beauty making beautiful old rhyme
696,18,"  in praise of ladies dead and lovely knights,"
697,18,"  then, in the blazon of sweet beauty's best,"
698,18,"  of hand, of foot, of lip, of eye, of brow,"
699,18,  i see their antique pen would have express'd
700,18,  even such a beauty as you master now.
701,18,  so all their praises are but prophecies
702,18,"  of this our time, all you prefiguring;"
703,18,"  and, for they look'd but with divining eyes,"
704,18,"  they had not skill enough your worth to sing,"
705,18,"  for we, which now behold these present days,"
706,18,"  have eyes to wonder, but lack tongues to praise."
707,19,"music to hear, why hear'st thou music sadly?"
708,19,"sweets with sweets war not, joy delights in joy."
709,19,"why lovest thou that which thou receivest not gladly,"
710,19,or else receivest with pleasure thine annoy?
711,19,"if the true concord of well-tuned sounds,"
712,19,"by unions married, do offend thine ear,"
713,19,"they do but sweetly chide thee, who confounds"
714,19,in singleness the parts that thou shouldst bear.
715,19,"mark how one string, sweet husband to another,"
716,19,"strikes each in each by mutual ordering,"
717,19,resembling sire and child and happy mother
718,19,"who all in one, one pleasing note do sing,"
719,19,"whose speechless song, being many, seeming one,"
720,19,"sings this to thee, 'thou single wilt prove none.'"
721,20,"not mine own fears, nor the prophetic soul"
722,20,"of the wide world dreaming on things to come,"
723,20,"can yet the lease of my true love control,"
724,20,suppos'd as forfeit to a confin'd doom.
725,20,the mortal moon hath her eclipse endur'd
726,20,and the sad augurs mock their own presage;
727,20,incertainties now crown themselves assur'd
728,20,and peace proclaims olives of endless age.
729,20,now with the drops of this most balmy time
730,20,"my love looks fresh, and death to me subscribes,"
731,20,"since, spite of him, i'll live in this poor rhyme,"
732,20,while he insults o'er dull and speechless tribes;
733,20,"and thou in this shalt find thy monument,"
734,20,when tyrants' crests and tombs of brass are spent.
735,21,"o, for my sake do you with fortune chide,"
736,21,"the guilty goddess of my harmful deeds,"
737,21,that did not better for my life provide
738,21,than public means which public manners breeds.
739,21,"thence comes it that my name receives a brand,"
740,21,and almost thence my nature is subdu'd
741,21,"to what it works in, like the dyer's hand."
742,21,pity me then and wish i were renew'd;
743,21,"whilst, like a willing patient, i will drink"
744,21,potions of eisel 'gainst my strong infection;
745,21,"no bitterness that i will bitter think,"
746,21,"nor double penance, to correct correction."
747,21,"pity me then, dear friend, and i assure ye"
748,21,even that your pity is enough to cure me.
749,22,those lips that love's own hand did make
750,22,breath'd forth the sound that said i hate
751,22,"to me that languish'd for her sake,"
752,22,"but when she saw my woeful state,"
753,22,straight in her heart did mercy come.
754,22,"chiding that tongue, that ever sweet"
755,22,"was used in giving gentle doom,"
756,22,"and taught it thus anew to greet,"
757,22,'i hate' she alter'd with an end
758,22,that follow'd it as gentle day
759,22,"doth follow night, who like a fiend"
760,22,from heaven to hell is flown away.
761,22,"'i hate' from hate away she threw,"
762,22,"and sav'd my life, saying 'not you'"
763,23,let me not to the marriage of true minds
764,23,admit impediments. love is not love
765,23,"which alters when it alteration finds,"
766,23,"or bends with the remover to remove,"
767,23,o no! it is an ever-fixed mark
768,23,that looks on tempests and is never shaken;
769,23,"it is the star to every wandering bark,"
770,23,"whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken."
771,23,"love's not time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks"
772,23,"within his bending sickle's compass come,"
773,23,"love alters not with his brief hours and weeks,"
774,23,but bears it out even to the edge of doom.
775,23,"if this be error and upon me proved,"
776,23,"i never writ, nor no man ever loved."
777,24,my mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun;
778,24,"   coral is far more red than her lips' red,"
779,24,"   if snow be white, why then her breasts are dun;"
780,24,"   if hairs be wires, black wires grow on her head."
781,24,"   i have seen roses damask'd, red and white,"
782,24,   but no such roses see i in her cheeks;
783,24,   and in some perfumes is there more delight
784,24,   than in the breath that from my mistress reeks.
785,24,"   i love to hear her speak, yet well i know"
786,24,  that music hath a far more pleasing sound.
787,24,"  i grant i never saw a goddess go,"
788,24,"  my mistress, when she walks, treads on the ground."
789,24,"  and yet, by heaven, i think my love as rare"
790,24,  as any she belied with false compare.
791,25,"from fairest creatures we desire increase,"
792,25,"that thereby beauty's rose might never die,"
793,25,"but as the riper should by time decease,"
794,25,"his tender heir might bear his memory,"
795,25,"but thou, contracted to thine own bright eyes,"
796,25,"feed'st thy light'st flame with self-substantial fuel,"
797,25,"making a famine where abundance lies,"
798,25,"thyself thy foe, to thy sweet self too cruel."
799,25,thou that art now the world's fresh ornament
800,25,"and only herald to the gaudy spring,"
801,25,within thine own bud buriest thy content
802,25,"and, tender churl, makest waste in niggarding."
803,25,"pity the world, or else this glutton be,"
804,25,"to eat the world's due, by the grave and thee."
805,26,"when forty winters shall besiege thy brow,"
806,26,"and dig deep trenches in thy beauty's field,"
807,26,"thy youth's proud livery, so gazed on now,"
808,26,"will be a tatter'd weed, of small worth held,"
809,26,"then being ask'd where all thy beauty lies,"
810,26,"where all the treasure of thy lusty days,"
811,26,"to say, within thine own deep-sunken eyes,"
812,26,were an all-eating shame and thriftless praise.
813,26,"how much more praise deserved thy beauty's use,"
814,26,if thou couldst answer 'this fair child of mine
815,26,"shall sum my count and make my old excuse,'"
816,26,proving his beauty by succession thine!
817,26,"this were to be new made when thou art old,"
818,26,and see thy blood warm when thou feel'st it cold.
819,27,"look in thy glass, and tell the face thou viewest"
820,27,now is the time that face should form another;
821,27,"whose fresh repair if now thou not renewest,"
822,27,"thou dost beguile the world, unbless some mother."
823,27,for where is she so fair whose unear'd womb
824,27,disdains the tillage of thy husbandry?
825,27,or who is he so fond will be the tomb
826,27,"of his self-love, to stop posterity?"
827,27,"thou art thy mother's glass, and she in thee"
828,27,"calls back the lovely april of her prime,"
829,27,so thou through windows of thine age shall see
830,27,despite of wrinkles this thy golden time.
831,27,"but if thou live, remember'd not to be,"
832,27,"die single, and thine image dies with thee."
833,28,"unthrifty loveliness, why dost thou spend"
834,28,upon thy self thy beauty's legacy?
835,28,"nature's bequest gives nothing, but doth lend,"
836,28,"and being frank she lends to those are free,"
837,28,"then, beauteous niggard, why dost thou abuse"
838,28,the bounteous largess given thee to give?
839,28,"profitless usurer, why dost thou use"
840,28,"so great a sum of sums, yet canst not live?"
841,28,"for having traffic with thy self alone,"
842,28,"thou of thy self thy sweet self dost deceive,"
843,28,"then how when nature calls thee to be gone,"
844,28,what acceptable audit canst thou leave?
845,28,"thy unused beauty must be tombed with thee,"
846,28,"which, used, lives th' executor to be."
847,29,when i have seen by time's fell hand defac'd
848,29,the rich proud cost of outworn buried age;
849,29,when sometime lofty towers i see down-ras'd
850,29,and brass eternal slave to mortal rage;
851,29,when i have seen the hungry ocean gain
852,29,"advantage on the kingdom of the shore,"
853,29,"and the firm soil win of the wat'ry main,"
854,29,increasing store with loss and loss with store;
855,29,"when i have seen such interchange of state,"
856,29,or state itself confounded to decay;
857,29,"ruin hath taught me thus to ruminate,"
858,29,that time will come and take my love away.
859,29,"this thought is as a death, which cannot choose"
860,29,but weep to have that which it fears to lose.
861,30,"those hours, that with gentle work did frame"
862,30,"the lovely gaze where every eye doth dwell,"
863,30,will play the tyrants to the very same
864,30,and that unfair which fairly doth excel;
865,30,for never-resting time leads summer on
866,30,"to hideous winter, and confounds him there;"
867,30,"sap checked with frost, and lusty leaves quite gone,"
868,30,"beauty o'er-snowed and bareness every where,"
869,30,"then were not summer's distillation left,"
870,30,"a liquid prisoner pent in walls of glass,"
871,30,"beauty's effect with beauty were bereft,"
872,30,"nor it, nor no remembrance what it was,"
873,30,"but flowers distill'd, though they with winter meet,"
874,30,leese but their show; their substance still lives sweet.
875,31,"they that have power to hurt and will do none,"
876,31,"that do not do the thing they most do show,"
877,31,"who, moving others, are themselves as stone,"
878,31,"unmoved, cold, and to temptation slow,"
879,31,they rightly do inherit heaven's graces
880,31,and husband nature's riches from expense;
881,31,"they are the lords and owners of their faces,"
882,31,others but stewards of their excellence.
883,31,the summer's flower is to the summer sweet
884,31,"though to itself it only live and die,"
885,31,"but if that flower with base infection meet,"
886,31,"the basest weed outbraves his dignity,"
887,31,for sweetest things turn sourest by their deeds;
888,31,lilies that fester smell far worse than weeds.
889,32,when i consider everything that grows
890,32,"holds in perfection but a little moment,"
891,32,that this huge stage presenteth nought but shows
892,32,whereon the stars in secret influence comment;
893,32,"when i perceive that men as plants increase,"
894,32,"cheered and check'd even by the selfsame sky,"
895,32,"vaunt in their youthful sap, at height decrease,"
896,32,and wear their brave state out of memory;
897,32,then the conceit of this inconstant stay
898,32,"sets you most rich in youth before my sight,"
899,32,where wasteful time debateth with decay
900,32,to change your day of youth to sullied night;
901,32,"and all in war with time for love of you,"
902,32,"as he takes from you, i engraft you new."
