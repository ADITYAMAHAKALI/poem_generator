59,1,       the trial by existence
60,1,           and to know definitely what he thinks about the soul;
61,1,       in equal sacrifice
62,1,           about love;
63,1,       the tuft of flowers

79,1,       my butterfly
80,1,           there are things that can never be the same.
81,1,       reluctance
82,2,"the farmhouse lingers, though averse to square"
83,2,with the new city street it has to wear
84,2,a number in. but what about the brook
85,2,that held the house as in an elbow-crook?
86,2,"i ask as one who knew the brook, its strength"
87,2,"and impulse, having dipped a finger length"
88,2,"and made it leap my knuckle, having tossed"
89,2,a flower to try its currents where they crossed.
90,2,the meadow grass could be cemented down
91,2,from growing under pavements of a town;
92,2,the apple trees be sent to hearth-stone flame.
93,2,is water wood to serve a brook the same?
94,2,how else dispose of an immortal force
95,2,no longer needed? staunch it at its source
96,2,with cinder loads dumped down? the brook was thrown
97,2,deep in a sewer dungeon under stone
98,2,in fetid darkness still to live and run  
99,2,and all for nothing it had ever done
100,2,except forget to go in fear perhaps.
101,2,no one would know except for ancient maps
102,2,that such a brook ran water. but i wonder
103,2,"if from its being kept forever under,"
104,2,the thoughts may not have risen that so keep
105,2,this new-built city from both work and sleep.
106,3,there sandy seems the golden sky
107,3,and golden seems the sandy plain.
108,3,no habitation meets the eye
109,3,"unless in the horizon rim,"
110,3,"some halfway up the limestone wall,"
111,3,that spot of black is not a stain
112,3,"or shadow, but a cavern hole,"
113,3,where someone used to climb and crawl
114,3,to rest from his besetting fears.
115,3,i see the callus on his soul
116,3,the disappearing last of him
117,3,"and of his race starvation slim,"
118,3,oh years ago - ten thousand years.
119,4,microscopic
120,4,a speck that would have been beneath my sight
121,4,on any but a paper sheet so white
122,4,set off across what i had written there.
123,4,and i had idly poised my pen in air
124,4,to stop it with a period of ink
125,4,"when something strange about it made me think,"
126,4,"this was no dust speck by my breathing blown,"
127,4,but unmistakably a living mite
128,4,with inclinations it could call its own.
129,4,"it paused as with suspicion of my pen,"
130,4,and then came racing wildly on again
131,4,to where my manuscript was not yet dry;
132,4,then paused again and either drank or smelt 
133,4,"with loathing, for again it turned to fly."
134,4,plainly with an intelligence i dealt.
135,4,"it seemed too tiny to have room for feet,"
136,4,yet must have had a set of them complete
137,4,to express how much it didn't want to die.
138,4,it ran with terror and with cunning crept.
139,4,"it faltered, i could see it hesitate;"
140,4,then in the middle of the open sheet
141,4,cower down in desperation to accept
142,4,whatever i accorded it of fate.
143,4,i have none of the tenderer-than-thou
144,4,collectivistic regimenting love
145,4,with which the modern world is being swept.
146,4,but this poor microscopic item now!
147,4,since it was nothing i knew evil of
148,4,i let it lie there till i hope it slept.
149,4,i have a mind myself and recognize
150,4,mind when i meet with it in any guise
151,4,no one can know how glad i am to find
152,4,on any sheet the least display of mind.
153,5,"i had withdrawn in forest, and my song"
154,5,was swallowed up in leaves that blew alway;
155,5,and to the forest edge you came one day
156,5,"this was my dream and looked and pondered long,"
157,5,"but did not enter, though the wish was strong,"
158,5,"you shook your pensive head as who should say,"
159,5,â€˜i dare not too far in his footsteps stray 
160,5,he must seek me would he undo the wrong.
161,5,"not far, but near, i stood and saw it all"
162,5,behind low boughs the trees let down outside;
163,5,and the sweet pang it cost me not to call
164,5,and tell you that i saw does still abide.
165,5,"but 'tis not true that thus i dwelt aloof,"
166,5,"for the wood wakes, and you are here for proof."
167,6,"when i go up through the mowing field,"
168,6,"the headless aftermath,"
169,6,"   smooth-laid like thatch with the heavy dew,"
170,6, half closes the garden path.
171,6,"   and when i come to the garden ground,"
172,6,the whir of sober birds
173,6, up from the tangle of withered weeds
174,6, is sadder than any words
175,6,"a tree beside the wall stands bare,"
176,6," but a leaf that lingered brown,"
177,6,"   disturbed, i doubt not, by my thought,"
178,6, comes softly rattling down.
179,6, i end not far from my going forth
180,6,   by picking the faded blue
181,6,of the last remaining aster flower
182,6, to carry again to you.
183,7,the line-storm clouds fly tattered and swift.
184,7," the road is forlorn all day,"
185,7,"where a myriad snowy quartz stones lift,"
186,7, and the hoof-prints vanish away.
187,7,"the roadside flowers, too wet for the bee,"
188,7, expend their bloom in vain.
189,7,"come over the hills and far with me,"
190,7, and be my love in the rain.
191,7,the birds have less to say for themselves
192,7, in the wood-world's torn despair
193,7,"than now these numberless years the elves,"
194,7," although they are no less there,"
195,7,all song of the woods is crushed like some
196,7," wild, earily shattered rose."
197,7,"come, be my love in the wet woods, come,"
198,7, where the boughs rain when it blows.
199,7,there is the gale to urge behind
200,7," and bruit our singing down,"
201,7,and the shallow waters aflutter with wind
202,7, from which to gather your gown.
203,7,"what matter if we go clear to the west,"
204,7, and come not through dry-shod?
205,7,for wilding brooch shall wet your breast
206,7, the rain-fresh goldenrod.
207,7,"oh, never this whelming east wind swells"
208,7, but it seems like the sea's return
209,7,to the ancient lands where it left the shells
210,7, before the age of the fern;
211,7,and it seems like the time when after doubt
212,7, our love came back amain.
213,7,"oh, come forth into the storm and rout"
214,7, and be my love in the rain.
215,8,"i have wished a bird would fly away,"
216,8,and not sing by my house all day;
217,8,have clapped my hands at him from the door
218,8,when it seemed as if i could bear no more.
219,8,the fault must partly have been in me.
220,8,the bird was not to blame for his key.
221,8,and of course there must be something wrong
222,8,in wanting to silence any song.
223,9,there's a patch of old snow in a corner
224,9,that i should have guessed
225,9,was a blow-away paper the rain
226,9,had brought to rest.
227,9,it is speckled with grime as if
228,9,"small print overspread it,"
229,9,the news of a day i've forgotten  
230,9,if i ever read it.
231,10,"oh, give us pleasure in the flowers today;"
232,10,and give us not to think so far away
233,10,as the uncertain harvest; keep us here
234,10,all simply in the springing of the year.
235,10,"oh, give us pleasure in the orchard white,"
236,10,"like nothing else by day, like ghosts by night;"
237,10,"and make us happy in the happy bees,"
238,10,the swarm dilating round the perfect trees.
239,10,and make us happy in the darting bird
240,10,"that suddenly above the bees is heard,"
241,10,"the meteor that thrusts in with needle bill,"
242,10,and off a blossom in mid air stands still.
243,10,"for this is love and nothing else is love,"
244,10,to which it is reserved for god above
245,10,"to sanctify to what far ends he will,"
246,10,but which it only needs that we fulfill.
247,11,"a voice said, look me in the stars"
248,11,"and tell me truly, men of earth,"
249,11,if all the soul-and-body scars
250,11,were not too much to pay for birth.
251,12,i didn't make you know how glad i was
252,12,to have you come and camp here on our land.
253,12,i promised myself to get down some day
254,12,"and see the way you lived, but i don't know!"
255,12,with a houseful of hungry men to feed
256,12,i guess you'd find.... it seems to me
257,12,i can't express my feelings any more
258,12,than i can raise my voice or want to lift
259,12,"my hand oh, i can lift it when i have to."
260,12,did ever you feel so? i hope you never.
261,12,it's got so i don't even know for sure
262,12,"whether i am glad, sorry, or anything."
263,12,there's nothing but a voice-like left inside
264,12,"that seems to tell me how i ought to feel,"
265,12,and would feel if i wasn't all gone wrong.
266,12,you take the lake. i look and look at it.
267,12,"i see it's a fair, pretty sheet of water."
268,12,i stand and make myself repeat out loud
269,12,"the advantages it has, so long and narrow,"
270,12,like a deep piece of some old running river
271,12,cut short off at both ends. it lies five miles
272,12,straight away through the mountain notch
273,12,"from the sink window where i wash the plates,"
274,12,"and all our storms come up toward the house,"
275,12,drawing the slow waves whiter and whiter and whiter.
276,12,it took my mind off doughnuts and soda biscuit
277,12,to step outdoors and take the water dazzle
278,12,"a sunny morning, or take the rising wind"
279,12,"about my face and body and through my wrapper,"
280,12,"when a storm threatened from the dragon's den,"
281,12,and a cold chill shivered across the lake.
282,12,"i see it's a fair, pretty sheet of water,"
283,12,our willoughby! how did you hear of it?
284,12,"i expect, though, everyone's heard of it."
285,12,in a book about ferns? listen to that!
286,12,you let things more like feathers regulate
287,12,your going and coming. and you like it here?
288,12,i can see how you might. but i don't know!
289,12,"it would be different if more people came,"
290,12,"for then there would be business. as it is,"
291,12,"the cottages len built, sometimes we rent them,"
292,12,sometimes we don't. we've a good piece of shore
293,12,"that ought to be worth something, and may yet."
294,12,but i don't count on it as much as len.
295,12,"he looks on the bright side of everything,"
296,12,including me. he thinks i'll be all right
297,12,with doctoring. but it's not medicine 
298,12,lowe is the only doctor's dared to say so 
299,12,"it's rest i want there, i have said it out "
300,12,from cooking meals for hungry hired men
301,12,and washing dishes after them from doing
302,12,things over and over that just won't stay done.
303,12,by good rights i ought not to have so much
304,12,"put on me, but there seems no other way."
305,12,len says one steady pull more ought to do it.
306,12,he says the best way out is always through.
307,12,"and i agree to that, or in so far"
308,12,as that i can see no way out but through 
309,12,leastways for me and then they'll be convinced.
310,12,it's not that len don't want the best for me.
311,12,it was his plan our moving over in
312,12,beside the lake from where that day i showed you
313,12,we used to live ten miles from anywhere.
314,12,"we didn't change without some sacrifice,"
315,12,but len went at it to make up the loss.
316,12,"his work's a man's, of course, from sun to sun,"
317,12,but he works when he works as hard as i do 
318,12,though there's small profit in comparisons.
319,12,women and men will make them all the same.
320,12,but work ain't all. len undertakes too much.
321,12,he's into everything in town. this year
322,12,"it's highways, and he's got too many men"
323,12,around him to look after that make waste.
324,12,"they take advantage of him shamefully,"
325,12,"and proud, too, of themselves for doing so."
326,12,"we have four here to board, great good-for-nothings,"
327,12,sprawling about the kitchen with their talk
328,12,while i fry their bacon. much they care!
329,12,no more put out in what they do or say
330,12,than if i wasn't in the room at all.
331,12,"coming and going all the time, they are,"
332,12,"i don't learn what their names are, let alone"
333,12,"their characters, or whether they are safe"
334,12,to have inside the house with doors unlocked.
335,12,"i'm not afraid of them, though, if they're not"
336,12,afraid of me. there's two can play at that.
337,12,"i have my fancies, it runs in the family."
338,12,my father's brother wasn't right. they kept him
339,12,locked up for years back there at the old farm.
340,12,"i've been away once yes, i've been away."
341,12,the state asylum. i was prejudiced;
342,12,i wouldn't have sent anyone of mine there;
343,12,you know the old idea the only asylum
344,12,"was the poorhouse, and those who could afford,"
345,12,"rather than send their folks to such a place,"
346,12,kept them at home; and it does seem more human.
347,12,"but it's not so, the place is the asylum."
348,12,"there they have every means proper to do with,"
349,12,and you aren't darkening other people's lives 
350,12,"worse than no good to them, and they no good"
351,12,to you in your condition; you can't know
352,12,affection or the want of it in that state.
353,12,i've heard too much of the old-fashioned way.
354,12,"my father's brother, he went mad quite young."
355,12,"some thought he had been bitten by a dog,"
356,12,because his violence took on the form
357,12,of carrying his pillow in his teeth;
358,12,"but it's more likely he was crossed in love,"
359,12,or so the story goes. it was some girl.
360,12,anyway all he talked about was love.
361,12,they soon saw he would do someone a mischief
362,12,"if he wa'n't kept strict watch of, and it ended"
363,12,"in father's building him a sort of cage,"
364,12,"or room within a room, of hickory poles,"
365,12,"like stanchions in the barn, from floor to ceiling, "
366,12,a narrow passage all the way around.
367,12,anything they put in for furniture
368,12,"he'd tear to pieces, even a bed to lie on."
369,12,"so they made the place comfortable with straw,"
370,12,"like a beast's stall, to ease their consciences."
371,12,of course they had to feed him without dishes.
372,12,"they tried to keep him clothed, but he paraded"
373,12,with his clothes on his arm all of his clothes.
374,12,cruel it sounds. i 'spose they did the best
375,12,"they knew. and just when he was at the height,"
376,12,"father and mother married, and mother came,"
377,12,"a bride, to help take care of such a creature,"
378,12,and accommodate her young life to his.
379,12,that was what marrying father meant to her.
380,12,she had to lie and hear love things made dreadful
381,12,by his shouts in the night. he'd shout and shout
382,12,"until the strength was shouted out of him,"
383,12,and his voice died down slowly from exhaustion.
384,12,"he'd pull his bars apart like bow and bow-string,"
385,12,and let them go and make them twang until
386,12,his hands had worn them smooth as any ox-bow.
387,12,and then he'd crow as if he thought that child's play 
388,12,"the only fun he had. i've heard them say, though,"
389,12,they found a way to put a stop to it.
390,12,he was before my time i never saw him;
391,12,but the pen stayed exactly as it was
392,12,"there in the upper chamber in the ell,"
393,12,a sort of catch-all full of attic clutter.
394,12,i often think of the smooth hickory bars.
395,12,"it got so i would say you know, half fooling "
396,12,"""it's time i took my turn upstairs in jail"" "
397,12,just as you will till it becomes a habit.
398,12,no wonder i was glad to get away.
399,12,"mind you, i waited till len said the word."
400,12,i didn't want the blame if things went wrong.
401,12,"i was glad though, no end, when we moved out,"
402,12,"and i looked to be happy, and i was,"
403,12,"as i said, for a while but i don't know!"
404,12,somehow the change wore out like a prescription.
405,12,and there's more to it than just window-views
406,12,and living by a lake. i'm past such help 
407,12,"unless len took the notion, which he won't,"
408,12,and i won't ask him it's not sure enough.
409,12,"i 'spose i've got to go the road i'm going,"
410,12,"other folks have to, and why shouldn't i?"
411,12,"i almost think if i could do like you,"
412,12,drop everything and live out on the ground 
413,12,"but it might be, come night, i shouldn't like it,"
414,12,"or a long rain. i should soon get enough,"
415,12,and be glad of a good roof overhead.
416,12,"i've lain awake thinking of you, i'll warrant,"
417,12,"more than you have yourself, some of these nights."
418,12,the wonder was the tents weren't snatched away
419,12,from over you as you lay in your beds.
420,12,i haven't courage for a risk like that.
421,12,"bless you, of course, you're keeping me from work,"
422,12,"but the thing of it is, i need to be kept."
423,12,there's work enough to do there's always that;
424,12,but behind's behind. the worst that you can do
425,12,is set me back a little more behind.
426,12,"i sha'n't catch up in this world, anyway."
427,12,i'd rather you'd not go unless you must.
428,13,"he is that fallen lance that lies as hurled,"
429,13,"that lies unlifted now, come dew, come rust,"
430,13,but still lies pointed as it plowed the dust.
431,13,"if we who sight along it round the world,"
432,13,"see nothing worthy to have been its mark,"
433,13,"it is because like men we look too near,"
434,13,"forgetting that as fitted to the sphere,"
435,13,our missiles always make too short an arc.
436,13,"they fall, they rip the grass, they intersect"
437,13,"the curve of earth, and striking, break their own;"
438,13,they make us cringe for metal-point on stone.
439,13,"but this we know, the obstacle that checked"
440,13,"and tripped the body, shot the spirit on"
441,13,further than target ever showed or shone.
442,14,when a friend calls to me from the road
443,14,"and slows his horse to a meaning walk,"
444,14,i don't stand still and look around
445,14,"on all the hills i haven't hoed,"
446,14,"and shout from where i am, what is it?"
447,14,"no, not as there is a time to talk."
448,14,"i thrust my hoe in the mellow ground,"
449,14,"blade-end up and five feet tall,"
450,14,"and plod, i go up to the stone wall"
451,14,for a friendly visit.
452,15,i have been one acquainted with the night.
453,15,i have walked out in rain   and back in rain.
454,15,i have outwalked the furthest city light.
455,15,i have looked down the saddest city lane.
456,15,i have passed by the watchman on his beat
457,15,"and dropped my eyes, unwilling to explain."
458,15,i have stood still and stopped the sound of feet
459,15,when far away an interrupted cry
460,15,"came over houses from another street,"
461,15,but not to call me back or say good-bye;
462,15,"and further still at an unearthly height,"
463,15,a luminary clock against the sky
464,15,proclaimed the time was neither wrong nor right.
465,15,i have been one acquainted with the night.
466,16,my long two-pointed ladder's sticking through a tree
467,16,"toward heaven still,"
468,16,and there's a barrel that i didn't fill
469,16,"beside it, and there may be two or three"
470,16,apples i didn't pick upon some bough.
471,16,but i am done with apple-picking now.
472,16,"essence of winter sleep is on the night,"
473,16,"the scent of apples, i am drowsing off."
474,16,i cannot rub the strangeness from my sight
475,16,i got from looking through a pane of glass
476,16,i skimmed this morning from the drinking trough
477,16,and held against the world of hoary grass.
478,16,"it melted, and i let it fall and break."
479,16,but i was well
480,16,"upon my way to sleep before it fell,"
481,16,and i could tell
482,16,what form my dreaming was about to take.
483,16,"magnified apples appear and disappear,"
484,16,"stem end and blossom end,"
485,16,and every fleck of russet showing clear.
486,16,"my instep arch not only keeps the ache,"
487,16,it keeps the pressure of a ladder-round.
488,16,i feel the ladder sway as the boughs bend.
489,16,and i keep hearing from the cellar bin
490,16,the rumbling sound
491,16,of load on load of apples coming in.
492,16,for i have had too much
493,16,"of apple-picking, i am overtired"
494,16,of the great harvest i myself desired.
495,16,"there were ten thousand thousand fruit to touch,"
496,16,"cherish in hand, lift down, and not let fall."
497,16,for all
498,16,"that struck the earth,"
499,16,"no matter if not bruised or spiked with stubble,"
500,16,went surely to the cider-apple heap
501,16,as of no worth.
502,16,one can see what will trouble
503,16,"this sleep of mine, whatever sleep it is."
504,16,"were he not gone,"
505,16,the woodchuck could say whether it's like his
506,16,"long sleep, as i describe its coming on,"
507,16,or just some human sleep.
508,17,all out of doors looked darkly in at him
509,17,"through the thin frost, almost in separate stars,"
510,17,that gathers on the pane in empty rooms.
511,17,what kept his eyes from giving back the gaze
512,17,was the lamp tilted near them in his hand.
513,17,what kept him from remembering what it was
514,17,that brought him to that creaking room was age.
515,17,he stood with barrels round him   at a loss.
516,17,and having scared the cellar under him
517,17,"in clomping there, he scared it once again"
518,17,"in clomping off;   and scared the outer night,"
519,17,"which has its sounds, familiar, like the roar"
520,17,"of trees and crack of branches, common things,"
521,17,but nothing so like beating on a box.
522,17,a light he was to no one but himself
523,17,"where now he sat, concerned with he knew what,"
524,17,"a quiet light, and then not even that."
525,17,"he consigned to the moon, such as she was,"
526,17,"so late-arising, to the broken moon"
527,17,as better than the sun in any case
528,17,"for such a charge, his snow upon the roof,"
529,17,his icicles along the wall to keep;
530,17,and slept. the log that shifted with a jolt
531,17,"once in the stove, disturbed him and he shifted,"
532,17,"and eased his heavy breathing, but still slept."
533,17,"one aged man   one man   can't keep a house,"
534,17,"a farm, a countryside, or if he can,"
535,17,it's thus he does it of a winter night.
536,18,"a house that lacks, seemingly, mistress and master,"
537,18,"with doors that none but the wind ever closes,"
538,18,its floor all littered with glass and with plaster;
539,18,it stands in a garden of old-fashioned roses.
540,18,i pass by that way in the gloaming with mary;
541,18,"'i wonder,' i say, 'who the owner of those is.'"
542,18,"'oh, no one you know,' she answers me airy,"
543,18,'but one we must ask if we want any roses.'
544,18,so we must join hands in the dew coming coldly
545,18,"there in the hush of the wood that reposes,"
546,18,"and turn and go up to the open door boldly,"
547,18,and knock to the echoes as beggars for roses.
548,18,"'pray, are you within there, mistress who-were-you?'"
549,18,'tis mary that speaks and our errand discloses.
550,18,"'pray, are you within there? bestir you, bestir you!"
551,18,'tis summer again; there's two come for roses.
552,18,"'a word with you, that of the singer recalling "
553,18,"old herrick, a saying that every maid knows is"
554,18,"a flower unplucked is but left to the falling,"
555,18,and nothing is gained by not gathering roses.'
556,18,we do not loosen our hands' intertwining
557,18,"not caring so very much what she supposes,"
558,18,there when she comes on us mistily shining
559,18,and grants us by silence the boon of her roses.
560,19,where had i heard this wind before
561,19,change like this to a deeper roar?
562,19,"what would it take my standing there for,"
563,19,"holding open a restive door,"
564,19,looking down hill to a frothy shore?
565,19,summer was past and the day was past.
566,19,sombre clouds in the west were massed.
567,19,"out on the porch's sagging floor,"
568,19,"leaves got up in a coil and hissed,"
569,19,blindly striking at my knee and missed.
570,19,something sinister in the tone
571,19,"told me my secret my be known,"
572,19,word i was in the house alone
573,19,"somehow must have gotten abroad,"
574,19,"word i was in my life alone,"
575,19,word i had no one left but god.
576,20,when i see birches bend to left and right
577,20,"across the lines of straighter darker trees,"
578,20,i like to think some boy's been swinging them.
579,20,but swinging doesn't bend them down to stay.
580,20,ice-storms do that. often you must have seen them
581,20,loaded with ice a sunny winter morning
582,20,after a rain. they click upon themselves
583,20,"as the breeze rises, and turn many-colored"
584,20,as the stir cracks and crazes their enamel.
585,20,soon the sun's warmth makes them shed crystal shells
586,20,shattering and avalanching on the snow-crust 
587,20,such heaps of broken glass to sweep away
588,20,you'd think the inner dome of heaven had fallen.
589,20,"they are dragged to the withered bracken by the load,"
590,20,and they seem not to break; though once they are bowed
591,20,"so low for long, they never right themselves,"
592,20,you may see their trunks arching in the woods
593,20,"years afterwards, trailing their leaves on the ground"
594,20,like girls on hands and knees that throw their hair
595,20,before them over their heads to dry in the sun.
596,20,but i was going to say when truth broke in
597,20,with all her matter-of-fact about the ice-storm
598,20,now am i free to be poetical?
599,20,i should prefer to have some boy bend them
600,20,as he went out and in to fetch the cows 
601,20,"some boy too far from town to learn baseball,"
602,20,"whose only play was what he found himself,"
603,20,"summer or winter, and could play alone."
604,20,one by one he subdued his father's trees
605,20,by riding them down over and over again
606,20,"until he took the stiffness out of them,"
607,20,"and not one but hung limp, not one was left"
608,20,for him to conquer. he learned all there was
609,20,to learn about not launching out too soon
610,20,and so not carrying the tree away
611,20,clear to the ground. he always kept his poise
612,20,"to the top branches, climbing carefully"
613,20,with the same pains you use to fill a cup
614,20,"up to the brim, and even above the brim."
615,20,"then he flung outward, feet first, with a swish,"
616,20,kicking his way down through the air to the ground.
617,20,so was i once myself a swinger of birches.
618,20,and so i dream of going back to be.
619,20,"it's when i'm weary of considerations,"
620,20,and life is too much like a pathless wood
621,20,where your face burns and tickles with the cobwebs
622,20,"broken across it, and one eye is weeping"
623,20,from a twig's having lashed across it open.
624,20,i'd like to get away from earth awhile
625,20,and then come back to it and begin over.
626,20,may no fate willfully misunderstand me
627,20,and half grant what i wish and snatch me away
628,20,"not to return. earth's the right place for love,"
629,20,i don't know where it's likely to go better.
630,20,"i'd like to go by climbing a birch tree,"
631,20,and climb black branches up a snow-white trunk
632,20,"toward heaven, till the tree could bear no more,"
633,20,but dipped its top and set me down again.
634,20,that would be good both going and coming back.
635,20,one could do worse than be a swinger of birches.
636,21,love has earth to which she clings
637,21,with hills and circling arms about 
638,21,wall within wall to shut fear out.
639,21,"but thought has need of no such things,"
640,21,for thought has a pair of dauntless wings.
641,21,"on snow and sand and turn, i see"
642,21,where love has left a printed trace
643,21,with straining in the world's embrace.
644,21,and such is love and glad to be
645,21,but thought has shaken his ankles free.
646,21,thought cleaves the interstellar gloom
647,21,"and sits in sirius' disc all night,"
648,21,till day makes him retrace his flight
649,21,"with smell of burning on every plume,"
650,21,back past the sun to an earthly room.
651,21,his gains in heaven are what they are.
652,21,yet some say love by being thrall
653,21,and simply staying possesses all
654,21,in several beauty that thought fares far
655,21,to find fused in another star.
656,22,"but outer space,"
657,22,"at least this far,"
658,22,for all the fuss
659,22,of the populace
660,22,stays more popular
661,22,than populous
662,23,"as i came to the edge of the woods,"
663,23,thrush music   hark!
664,23,"now if it was dusk outside,"
665,23,inside it was dark.
666,23,too dark in the woods for a bird
667,23,by sleight of wing
668,23,"to better its perch for the night,"
669,23,though it still could sing.
670,23,the last of the light of the sun
671,23,that had died in the west
672,23,still lived for one song more
673,23,in a thrush's breast.
674,23,far in the pillared dark
675,23,thrush music went  
676,23,almost like a call to come in
677,23,to the dark and lament.
678,23,"but no, i was out for stars;"
679,23,i would not come in.
680,23,i meant not even if asked;
681,23,and i hadn't been.
682,24,an ant on the tablecloth
683,24,ran into a dormant moth
684,24,of many times his size.
685,24,he showed not the least surprise.
686,24,his business wasn't with such.
687,24,"he gave it scarcely a touch,"
688,24,and was off on his duty run.
689,24,yet if he encountered one
690,24,of the hive's enquiry squad
691,24,whose work is to find out god
692,24,"and the nature of time and space,"
693,24,he would put him onto the case.
694,24,ants are a curious race;
695,24,one crossing with hurried tread
696,24,the body of one of their dead
697,24,isn't given a moment's arrest-
698,24,seems not even impressed.
699,24,but he no doubt reports to any
700,24,"with whom he crosses antennae,"
701,24,and they no doubt report
702,24,to the higher-up at court.
703,24,"then word goes forth in formic,"
704,24,"""death's come to jerry mccormic,"
705,24,our selfless forager jerry.
706,24,will the special janizary
707,24,whose office it is to bury
708,24,the dead of the commissary
709,24,go bring him home to his people.
710,24,lay him in state on a sepal.
711,24,wrap him for shroud in a petal.
712,24,embalm him with ichor of nettle.
713,24,"this is the word of your queen."""
714,24,and presently on the scene
715,24,appears a solemn mortician;
716,24,"and taking formal position,"
717,24,"with feelers calmly atwiddle,"
718,24,"seizes the dead by the middle,"
719,24,"and heaving him high in air,"
720,24,carries him out of there.
721,24,no one stands round to stare.
722,24,it is nobody else's affair
723,24,it couldn't be called ungentle
724,24,but how thoroughly departmental
725,25,"snow falling and night falling fast, oh, fast"
726,25,"in a field i looked into going past,"
727,25,"and the ground almost covered smooth in snow,"
728,25,but a few weeds and stubble showing last.
729,25,the woods around it have it - it is theirs.
730,25,all animals are smothered in their lairs.
731,25,i am too absent-spirited to count;
732,25,the loneliness includes me unawares.
733,25,"and lonely as it is, that loneliness"
734,25,will be more lonely ere it will be less -
735,25,a blanker whiteness of benighted snow
736,25,"with no expression, nothing to express."
737,25,they cannot scare me with their empty spaces
738,25,between stars - on stars where no human race is.
739,25,i have it in me so much nearer home
740,25,to scare myself with my own desert places.
741,26,"i found a dimpled spider, fat and white,"
742,26,"on a white heal-all, holding up a moth"
743,26,like a white piece of rigid satin cloth  
744,26,assorted characters of death and blight
745,26,"mixed ready to begin the morning right,"
746,26,like the ingredients of a witches' broth  
747,26,"a snow-drop spider, a flower like a froth,"
748,26,and dead wings carried like a paper kite.
749,26,"what had that flower to do with being white,"
750,26,the wayside blue and innocent heal-all?
751,26,"what brought the kindred spider to that height,"
752,26,then steered the white moth thither in the night?
753,26,what but design of darkness to appall? 
754,26,if design govern in a thing so small.
755,27,the heart can think of no devotion
756,27,greater than being shore to ocean -
757,27,"holding the curve of one position,"
758,27,counting an endless repetition.
759,28,the way a crow
760,28,shook down on me
761,28,the dust of snow
762,28,from a hemlock tree
763,28,has given my heart
764,28,a change of mood
765,28,and saved some part
766,28,of a day i had rued.
767,29,from where i lingered in a lull in march
768,29,"outside the sugar-house one night for choice,"
769,29,i called the fireman with a careful voice
770,29,"and bade him leave the pan and stoke the arch,"
771,29,"'o fireman, give the fire another stoke,"
772,29,and send more sparks up chimney with the smoke.'
773,29,"i thought a few might tangle, as they did,"
774,29,"among bare maple boughs, and in the rare"
775,29,"hill atmosphere not cease to glow,"
776,29,and so be added to the moon up there.
777,29,"the moon, though slight, was moon enough to show"
778,29,"on every tree a bucket with a lid,"
779,29,and on black ground a bear-skin rug of snow.
780,29,the sparks made no attempt to be the moon.
781,29,they were content to figure in the trees
782,29,"as leo, orion, and the pleiades."
783,29,and that was what the boughs were full of soon.
784,30,"some say the world will end in fire,"
785,30,  some say in ice.
786,30,  from what i've tasted of desire
787,30,  i hold with those who favor fire.
788,30,"  but if it had to perish twice,"
789,30,  i think i know enough of hate
790,30,  to know that for destruction ice
791,30,  is also great
792,30,  and would suffice.
793,31,"here come real stars to fill the upper skies,"
794,31,"and here on earth come emulating flies,"
795,31,"that though they never equal stars in size,"
796,31,and they were never really stars at heart
797,31,achieve at times a very star-like start.
798,31,"only, of course, they can't sustain the part."
799,32,"i left you in the morning,"
800,32,"and in the morning glow,"
801,32,you walked a way beside me
802,32,to make me sad to go.
803,32,"do you know me in the gloaming,"
804,32,gaunt and dusty gray with roaming?
805,32,"are you dumb because you know me not,"
806,32,or dumb because you know?
807,32,all for me  and not a question
808,32,for the faded flowers gay
809,32,that could take me from beside you
810,32,for the ages of a day?
811,32,"they are yours, and be the measure"
812,32,"of their worth for you to treasure,"
813,32,the measure of the little while
814,32,that i've been long away.
815,33,others taught me with having knelt at well-curbs
816,33,"  always wrong to the light, so never seeing"
817,33,  deeper down in the well than where the water
818,33,  gives me back in a shining surface picture
819,33,  me myself in the summer heaven godlike
820,33,  looking out of a wreath of fern and cloud puffs.
821,33,"  once, when trying with chin against a well-curb,"
822,33,"  i discerned, as i thought, beyond the picture,"
823,33,"  through the picture, a something white, uncertain,"
824,33, something more of the depths and then i lost it.
825,33, water came to rebuke the too clear water.
826,33," one drop fell from a fern, and lo, a ripple"
827,33," shook whatever it was lay there at bottom,"
828,33," blurred it, blotted it out. what was that whiteness?"
829,33," truth? a pebble of quartz? for once, then, something."
830,34,why make so much of fragmentary blue
831,34,"in here and there a bird, or butterfly,"
832,34,"or flower, or wearing-stone, or open eye,"
833,34,when heaven presents in sheets the solid hue?
834,34,"since earth is earth, perhaps, not heaven as yet "
835,34,though some savants make earth include the sky;
836,34,"and blue so far above us comes so high,"
837,34,it only gives our wish for blue a whet.
838,35,spades take up leaves
839,35,"no better than spoons,"
840,35,and bags full of leaves
841,35,are light as balloons.
842,35,i make a great noise
843,35,of rustling all day
844,35,like rabbit and deer
845,35,running away.
846,35,but the mountains i raise
847,35,"elude my embrace,"
848,35,flowing over my arms
849,35,and into my face.
850,35,i may load and unload
851,35,again and again
852,35,"till i fill the whole shed,"
853,35,and what have i then?
854,35,"next to nothing for weight,"
855,35,and since they grew duller
856,35,"from contact with earth,"
857,35,next to nothing for color.
858,35,next to nothing for use.
859,35,"but a crop is a crop,"
860,35,and who's to say where
861,35,the harvest shall stop?
862,36,i dwell in a lonely house i know
863,36,"that vanished many a summer ago,"
864,36,"and left no trace but the cellar walls,"
865,36,"and a cellar in which the daylight falls,"
866,36,and the purple-stemmed wild raspberries grow.
867,36,o'er ruined fences the grape-vines shield
868,36,the woods come back to the mowing field;
869,36,the orchard tree has grown one copse
870,36,of new wood and old where the woodpecker chops;
871,36,the footpath down to the well is healed.
872,36,i dwell with a strangely aching heart
873,36,in that vanished abode there far apart
874,36,on that disused and forgotten road
875,36,that has no dust-bath now for the toad.
876,36,night comes; the black bats tumble and dart;
877,36,the whippoorwill is coming to shout
878,36,"and hush and cluck and flutter about,"
879,36,i hear him begin far enough away
880,36,full many a time to say his say
881,36,before he arrives to say it out.
882,36,"it is under the small, dim, summer star."
883,36,i know not who these mute folk are
884,36,who share the unlit place with me 
885,36,those stones out under the low-limbed tree
886,36,doubtless bear names that the mosses mar.
887,36,"they are tireless folk, but slow and sad,"
888,36,"though two, close-keeping, are lass and lad, "
889,36,"with none among them that ever sings,"
890,36,"and yet, in view of how many things,"
891,36,as sweet companions as might be had.
892,37,"the well was dry beside the door,"
893,37,and so we went with pail and can
894,37,across the fields behind the house
895,37,to seek the brook if still it ran;
896,37,"not loth to have excuse to go,"
897,37,because the autumn eve was fair
898,37,"though chill, because the fields were ours,"
899,37,and by the brook our woods were there.
900,37,we ran as if to meet the moon
901,37,"that slowly dawned behind the trees,"
902,37,"the barren boughs without the leaves,"
903,37,"without the birds, without the breeze."
904,37,"but once within the wood, we paused"
905,37,"like gnomes that hid us from the moon,"
906,37,ready to run to hiding new
907,37,with laughter when she found us soon.
908,37,each laid on other a staying hand
909,37,"to listen ere we dared to look,"
910,37,and in the hush we joined to make
911,37,"we heard, we knew we heard the brook."
912,37,"a note as from a single place,"
913,37,a slender tinkling fall that made
914,37,now drops that floated on the pool
915,37,"like pearls, and now a silver blade."
916,38,this saying good-bye on the edge of the dark
917,38,  and cold to an orchard so young in the bark
918,38,  reminds me of all that can happen to harm
919,38,  an orchard away at the end of the farm
920,38,"  all winter, cut off by a hill from the house."
921,38,"  i don't want it girdled by rabbit and mouse,"
922,38,  i don't want it dreamily nibbled for browse
923,38,"  by deer, and i don't want it budded by grouse."
924,38,  if certain it wouldn't be idle to call
925,38," i'd summon grouse, rabbit, and deer to the wall"
926,38, and warn them away with a stick for a gun.
927,38, i don't want it stirred by the heat of the sun.
928,38," we made it secure against being, i hope,"
929,38, by setting it out on a northerly slope.
930,38, no orchard's the worse for the wintriest storm;
931,38," but one thing about it, it mustn't get warm."
932,38," ""how often already you've had to be told,"
933,38," keep cold, young orchard. good-bye and keep cold."

935,38, i have to be gone for a season or so.
936,38," my business awhile is with different trees,"
937,38," less carefully nourished, less fruitful than these,"
938,38, and such as is done to their wood with an axe 
939,38, maples and birches and tamaracks.
940,38, i wish i could promise to lie in the night
941,38, and think of an orchard's arboreal plight
942,38, when slowly and nobody comes with a light
943,38, its heart sinks lower under the sod.
944,38, but something has to be left to god.

1243,51,he asked with the eyes more than the lips
1244,51,"for a shelter for the night,"
1245,51,and he turned and looked at the road afar
1246,51,without a window light.
1247,51,the bridegroom came forth into the porch
1248,51,"with, 'let us look at the sky,"
1249,51,"and question what of the night to be,"
1250,51,"stranger, you and i.'"
1251,51,"the woodbine leaves littered the yard,"
1252,51,"the woodbine berries were blue,"
1253,51,"autumn, yes, winter was in the wind;"
1254,51,"'stranger, i wish i knew.'"
1255,51,"within, the bride in the dusk alone"
1256,51,"bent over the open fire,"
1257,51,her face rose-red with the glowing coal
1258,51,and the thought of the heart's desire.
1259,51,"the bridegroom looked at the weary road,"
1260,51,"yet saw but her within,"
1261,51,and wished her heart in a case of gold
1262,51,and pinned with a silver pin.
1263,51,the bridegroom thought it little to give
1264,51,"a dole of bread, a purse,"
1265,51,"a heartfelt prayer for the poor of god,"
1266,51,or for the rich a curse;
1267,51,but whether or not a man was asked
1268,51,to mar the love of two
1269,51,"by harboring woe in the bridal house,"
1270,51,the bridegroom wished he knew.
1271,52,as i went down the hill along the wall
1272,52,there was a gate i had leaned at for the view
1273,52,and had just turned from when i first saw you
1274,52,as you came up the hill. we met. but all
1275,52,we did that day was mingle great and small
1276,52,footprints in summer dust as if we drew
1277,52,the figure of our being less that two
1278,52,but more than one as yet. your parasol
1279,52,pointed the decimal off with one deep thrust.
1280,52,and all the time we talked you seemed to see
1281,52,something down there to smile at in the dust.
1282,52,"oh, it was without prejudice to me!"
1283,52,afterward i went past what you had passed
1284,52,before we met and you what i had passed.
1285,53,"something there is that doesn't love a wall,"
1286,53,"that sends the frozen-ground-swell under it,"
1287,53,and spills the upper boulders in the sun;
1288,53,and makes gaps even two can pass abreast.
1289,53,"the work of hunters is another thing,"
1290,53,i have come after them and made repair
1291,53,"where they have left not one stone on a stone,"
1292,53,"but they would have the rabbit out of hiding,"
1293,53,"to please the yelping dogs. the gaps i mean,"
1294,53,"no one has seen them made or heard them made,"
1295,53,but at spring mending-time we find them there.
1296,53,i let my neighbor know beyond the hill;
1297,53,and on a day we meet to walk the line
1298,53,and set the wall between us once again.
1299,53,we keep the wall between us as we go.
1300,53,to each the boulders that have fallen to each.
1301,53,and some are loaves and some so nearly balls
1302,53,"we have to use a spell to make them balance,"
1303,53,"""stay where you are until our backs are turned!"""
1304,53,we wear our fingers rough with handling them.
1305,53,"oh, just another kind of out-door game,"
1306,53,"one on a side. it comes to little more,"
1307,53,"there where it is we do not need the wall,"
1308,53,he is all pine and i am apple orchard.
1309,53,my apple trees will never get across
1310,53,"and eat the cones under his pines, i tell him."
1311,53,"he only says, ""good fences make good neighbors."""
1312,53,"spring is the mischief in me, and i wonder"
1313,53,"if i could put a notion in his head,"
1314,53,"""why do they make good neighbors? isn't it"
1315,53,where there are cows? but here there are no cows.
1316,53,before i built a wall i'd ask to know
1317,53,"what i was walling in or walling out,"
1318,53,and to whom i was like to give offence.
1319,53,"something there is that doesn't love a wall,"
1320,53,"that wants it down."" i could say ""elves"" to him,"
1321,53,"but it's not elves exactly, and i'd rather"
1322,53,he said it for himself. i see him there
1323,53,bringing a stone grasped firmly by the top
1324,53,"in each hand, like an old-stone savage armed."
1325,53,"he moves in darkness as it seems to me,"
1326,53,not of woods only and the shade of trees.
1327,53,"he will not go behind his father's saying,"
1328,53,and he likes having thought of it so well
1329,53,"he says again, ""good fences make good neighbors."""
1330,54,"there was never a sound beside the wood but one,"
1331,54,and that was my long scythe whispering to the ground.
1332,54,what was it it whispered? i knew not well myself;
1333,54,"perhaps it was something about the heat of the sun,"
1334,54,"something, perhaps, about the lack of sound "
1335,54,and that was why it whispered and did not speak.
1336,54,"it was no dream of the gift of idle hours,"
1337,54,"or easy gold at the hand of fay or elf,"
1338,54,anything more than the truth would have seemed too weak
1339,54,"to the earnest love that laid the swale in rows,"
1340,54,not without feeble-pointed spikes of flowers
1341,54,"pale orchises, and scared a bright green snake."
1342,54,the fact is the sweetest dream that labour knows.
1343,54,my long scythe whispered and left the hay to make.
1344,55,"thine emulous fond flowers are dead, too,"
1345,55,"and the daft sun-assaulter, he"
1346,55,"that frightened thee so oft, is fled or dead,"
1347,55,save only me
1348,55,nor is it sad to thee!
1349,55,save only me
1350,55,there is none left to mourn thee in the fields.
1351,55,the gray grass is scarce dappled with the snow;
1352,55,its two banks have not shut upon the river;
1353,55,but it is long ago 
1354,55,it seems forever 
1355,55,"since first i saw thee glance,"
1356,55,"with all thy dazzling other ones,"
1357,55,"in airy dalliance,"
1358,55,"precipitate in love,"
1359,55,"tossed, tangled, whirled and whirled above,"
1360,55,like a limp rose-wreath in a fairy dance.
1361,55,"when that was, the soft mist"
1362,55,"of my regret hung not on all the land,"
1363,55,"and i was glad for thee,"
1364,55,"and glad for me, i wist."
1365,55,"thou didst not know, who tottered, wandering on high,"
1366,55,"that fate had made thee for the pleasure of the wind,"
1367,55,"with those great careless wings,"
1368,55,nor yet did i.
1369,55,"and there were other things,"
1370,55,"it seemed god let thee flutter from his gentle clasp,"
1371,55,then fearful he had let thee win
1372,55,"too far beyond him to be gathered in,"
1373,55,"santched thee, o'ereager, with ungentle gasp."
1374,55,ah! i remember me
1375,55,how once conspiracy was rife
1376,55,against my life 
1377,55,the languor of it and the dreaming fond;
1378,55,"surging, the grasses dizzied me of thought,"
1379,55,"the breeze three odors brought,"
1380,55,and a gem-flower waved in a wand!
1381,55,then when i was distraught
1382,55,"and could not speak,"
1383,55,"sidelong, full on my cheek,"
1384,55,what should that reckless zephyr fling
1385,55,but the wild touch of thy dye-dusty wing!
1386,55,i found that wing broken today!
1387,55,"for thou art dead, i said,"
1388,55,and the strange birds say.
1389,55,i found it with the withered leaves
1390,55,under the eaves.
1391,56,"my sorrow, when she's here with me,"
1392,56,thinks these dark days of autumn rain
1393,56,are beautiful as days can be;
1394,56,"she loves the bare, the withered tree;"
1395,56,she walks the sodden pasture lane.
1396,56,her pleasure will not let me stay.
1397,56,"she talks and i am fain to list,"
1398,56,"she's glad the birds are gone away,"
1399,56,she's glad her simple worsted grey
1400,56,is silver now with clinging mist.
1401,56,"the desolate, deserted trees,"
1402,56,"the faded earth, the heavy sky,"
1403,56,"the beauties she so truly sees,"
1404,56,"she thinks i have no eye for these,"
1405,56,and vexes me for reason why.
1406,56,not yesterday i learned to know
1407,56,the love of bare november days
1408,56,"before the coming of the snow,"
1409,56,"but it were vain to tell her so,"
1410,56,and they are better for her praise
1411,57,the people along the sand
1412,57,all turn and look one way.
1413,57,they turn their back on the land.
1414,57,they look at the sea all day.
1415,57,as long as it takes to pass
1416,57,a ship keeps raising its hull;
1417,57,the wetter ground like glass
1418,57,reflects a standing gull
1419,57,the land may vary more;
1420,57,but wherever the truth may be 
1421,57,"the water comes ashore,"
1422,57,and the people look at the sea.
1423,57,they cannot look out far.
1424,57,they cannot look in deep.
1425,57,btu when was that ever a bar
1426,57,to any watch they keep?
1427,58,he would declare and could himself believe
1428,58,that the birds there in all the garden round
1429,58,from having heard the daylong voice of eve
1430,58,"had added to their own an oversound,"
1431,58,her tone of meaning but without the words.
1432,58,admittedly an eloquence so soft
1433,58,could only have had an influence on birds
1434,58,when call or laughter carried it aloft.
1435,58,"be that as may be, she was in their song."
1436,58,moreover her voice upon their voices crossed
1437,58,had now persisted in the woods so long
1438,58,that probably it never would be lost.
1439,58,never again would birds' song be the same.
1440,58,and to do that to birds was why she came.
1441,59,they sent him back to her. the letter came
1442,59,saying... and she could have him. and before
1443,59,she could be sure there was no hidden ill
1444,59,"under the formal writing, he was in her sight,"
1445,59,living. they gave him back to her alive
1446,59,how else? they are not known to send the dead
1447,59,and not disfigured visibly. his face?
1448,59,"his hands? she had to look, and ask,"
1449,59,"""what was it, dear?"" and she had given all"
1450,59,and still she had all they had they the lucky!
1451,59,"wasnâ€™t she glad now? everything seemed won,"
1452,59,and all the rest for them permissible ease.
1453,59,"she had to ask, ""what was it, dear?"""
1454,59,"""enough,"""
1455,59,"yet not enough. a bullet through and through,"
1456,59,high in the breast. nothing but what good care
1457,59,"and medicine and rest, and you a week,"
1458,59,"can cure me of to go again."" the same"
1459,59,grim giving to do over for them both.
1460,59,she dared no more than ask him with her eyes
1461,59,how was it with him for a second trial.
1462,59,and with his eyes he asked her not to ask.
1463,59,"they had given him back to her, but not to keep."
1464,60,"nature's first green is gold,"
1465,60,her hardest hue to hold.
1466,60,her early leaf's a flower;
1467,60,but only so an hour.
1468,60,then leaf subsides to leaf.
1469,60,"so eden sank to grief,"
1470,60,so dawn goes down to day.
1471,60,nothing gold can stay.
1472,61,"now close the windows and hush all the fields,"
1473,61,"if the trees must, let them silently toss;"
1474,61,"no bird is singing now, and if there is,"
1475,61,be it my loss.
1476,61,"it will be long ere the marshes resume,"
1477,61,"i will be long ere the earliest bird,"
1478,61,"so close the windows and not hear the wind,"
1479,61,but see all wind-stirred.
