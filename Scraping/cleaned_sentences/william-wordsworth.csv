72,2,there is a change and i am poor;
73,2,"your love hath been, nor long ago,"
74,2,"a fountain at my fond heart's door,"

90,3,"a narrow girdle of rough stones and crags,"
91,3,"a rude and natural causeway, interposed"
92,3,between the water and a winding slope
93,3,"of copse and thicket, leaves the eastern shore"
94,3,"of grasmere safe in its own privacy,"
95,3,"and there myself and two beloved friends,"
96,3,"one calm september morning, ere the mist"
97,3,"had altogether yielded to the sun,"
98,3,sauntered on this retired and difficult way.
99,3, -ill suits the road with one in haste; but we
100,3,"played with our time; and, as we strolled along,"
101,3,it was our occupation to observe
102,3,such objects as the waves had tossed ashore 
103,3,"feather, or leaf, or weed, or withered bough,"
104,3,"each on the other heaped, along the line"
105,3,"of the dry wreck. and, in our vacant mood,"
106,3,not seldom did we stop to watch some tuft
107,3,"of dandelion seed or thistle's beard,"
108,3,"that skimmed the surface of the dead calm lake,"
109,3,suddenly halting now a lifeless stand!
110,3,and starting off again with freak as sudden;
111,3,"in all its sportive wanderings, all the while,"
112,3,making report of an invisible breeze
113,3,"that was its wings, its chariot, and its horse,"
114,3,"its playmate, rather say, its moving soul."
115,3," and often, trifling with a privilege"
116,3,"alike indulged to all, we paused, one now,"
117,3,"and now the other, to point out, perchance"
118,3,"to pluck, some flower or water-weed, too fair"
119,3,either to be divided from the place
120,3,"on which it grew, or to be left alone"
121,3,"to its own beauty. many such there are,"
122,3,"fair ferns and flowers, and chiefly that tall fern,"
123,3,"so stately, of the queen osmunda named;"
124,3,"plant lovelier, in its own retired abode"
125,3,"on grasmere's beach, than naiad by the side"
126,3,"of grecian brook, or lady of the mere,"
127,3,sole-sitting by the shores of old romance.
128,3," so fared we that bright morning, from the fields"
129,3,"meanwhile, a noise was heard, the busy mirth"
130,3,"of reapers, men and women, boys and girls."
131,3,"delighted much to listen to those sounds,"
132,3,"and feeding thus our fancies, we advanced"
133,3,"along the indented shore; when suddenly,"
134,3,through a thin veil of glittering haze was seen
135,3,"before us, on a point of jutting land,"
136,3,the tall and upright figure of a man
137,3,"attired in peasant's garb, who stood alone,"
138,3,angling beside the margin of the lake.
139,3,"""improvident and reckless,"" we exclaimed,"
140,3,"""the man must be, who thus can lose a day"
141,3,"of the mid harvest, when the labourer's hire"
142,3,"is ample, and some little might be stored"
143,3,"wherewith to cheer him in the winter time."""
144,3,"thus talking of that peasant, we approached"
145,3,close to the spot where with his rod and line
146,3,he stood alone; whereat he turned his head
147,3,to greet us and we saw a mam worn down
148,3,"by sickness, gaunt and lean, with sunken cheeks"
149,3,"and wasted limbs, his legs so long and lean"
150,3,"that for my single self i looked at them,"
151,3,forgetful of the body they sustained. 
152,3,"too weak to labour in the harvest field,"
153,3,the man was using his best skill to gain
154,3,a pittance from the dead unfeeling lake
155,3,that knew not of his wants. i will not say
156,3,"what thoughts immediately were ours, nor how"
157,3,"the happy idleness of that sweet morn,"
158,3,"with all its lovely images, was changed"
159,3,to serious musing and to self-reproach.
160,3,nor did we fail to see within ourselves
161,3,"what need there is to be reserved in speech,"
162,3,and temper all our thoughts with charity.
163,3," therefore, unwilling to forget that day,"
164,3,"my friend, myself, and she who then received"
165,3,"the same admonishment, have called the place"
166,3,"by a memorial name, uncouth indeed"
167,3,as e'er by mariner was given to bay
168,3,"or foreland, on a new-discovered coast;"
169,3,and point rash-judgment is the name it bears.
170,4,lo! where the moon along the sky
171,4,sails with her happy destiny;
172,4,oft is she hid from mortal eye
173,4,"or dimly seen,"
174,4,but when the clouds asunder fly
175,4,how bright her mien!
176,4,"far different we a froward race,"
177,4,thousands though rich in fortune's grace
178,4,with cherished sullenness of pace
179,4,"their way pursue,"
180,4,ingrates who wear a smileless face
181,4,the whole year through.
182,4,if kindred humours e'er would make
183,4,"my spirit droop for drooping's sake,"
184,4,"from fancy following in thy wake,"
185,4,bright ship of heaven!
186,4,a counter impulse let me take
187,4,and be forgiven.
188,5,  the sky is overcast
189,5,"with a continuous cloud of texture close,"
190,5,"heavy and wan, all whitened by the moon,"
191,5,"which through that veil is indistinctly seen,"
192,5,"a dull, contracted circle, yielding light"
193,5,"so feebly spread, that not a shadow falls,"
194,5,"chequering the ground from rock, plant, tree, or tower."
195,5,at length a pleasant instantaneous gleam
196,5,startles the pensive traveller while he treads
197,5,"his lonesome path, with unobserving eye"
198,5,bent earthwards; he looks up the clouds are split
199,5,"asunder, and above his head he sees"
200,5,"the clear moon, and the glory of the heavens."
201,5,"there, in a black-blue vault she sails along,"
202,5,"followed by multitudes of stars, that, small"
203,5,"and sharp, and bright, along the dark abyss"
204,5,"drive as she drives, how fast they wheel away,"
205,5,"yet vanish not! the wind is in the tree,"
206,5,but they are silent; still they roll along
207,5,"immeasurably distant; and the vault,"
208,5,"built round by those white clouds, enormous clouds,"
209,5,still deepens its unfathomable depth.
210,5,"at length the vision closes; and the mind,"
211,5,"not undisturbed by the delight it feels,"
212,5,"which slowly settles into peaceful calm,"
213,5,is left to muse upon the solemn scene.
214,6,".    a poet! he hath put his heart to school,"
215,6,   nor dares to move unpropped upon the staff
216,6,   which art hath lodged within his hand must laugh
217,6,"   by precept only, and shed tears by rule."
218,6,"   thy art be nature; the live current quaff,"
219,6,"   and let the groveller sip his stagnant pool,"
220,6,"   in fear that else, when critics grave and cool"
221,6,"   have killed him, scorn should write his epitaph."
222,6,   how does the meadow-flower its bloom unfold?
223,6,  because the lovely little flower is free
224,6,"  down to its root, and, in that freedom, bold;"
225,6,  and so the grandeur of the forest-tree
226,6,"  comes not by casting in a formal mould,"
227,6,  but from its own divine vitality.
228,7,art thou a statist in the van
229,7,of public conflicts trained and bred?
230,7, first learn to love one living man;
231,7,'then' may'st thou think upon the dead.
232,7,a lawyer art thou? draw not nigh!
233,7,"go, carry to some fitter place"
234,7,"the keenness of that practised eye,"
235,7,the hardness of that sallow face.
236,7,art thou a man of purple cheer?
237,7,"a rosy man, right plump to see?"
238,7,"approach; yet, doctor, not too near,"
239,7,this grave no cushion is for thee.
240,7,"or art thou one of gallant pride,"
241,7,a soldier and no man of chaff?
242,7,"welcome! but lay thy sword aside,"
243,7,and lean upon a peasant's staff.
244,7,"physician art thou? one, all eyes,"
245,7,"philosopher! a fingering slave,"
246,7,one that would peep and botanise
247,7,upon his mother's grave?
248,7,"wrapt closely in thy sensual fleece,"
249,7,"o turn aside, and take, i pray,"
250,7,"that he below may rest in peace,"
251,7,"thy ever-dwindling soul, away!"
252,7,a moralist perchance appears;
253,7,"led, heaven knows how! to this poor sod,"
254,7,and he has neither eyes nor ears;
255,7,"himself his world, and his own god;"
256,7,one to whose smooth-rubbed soul can cling
257,7,"nor form, nor feeling, great or small;"
258,7,"a reasoning, self-sufficing thing,"
259,7,an intellectual all-in-all!
260,7,shut close the door; press down the latch;
261,7,sleep in thy intellectual crust;
262,7,nor lose ten tickings of thy watch
263,7,near this unprofitable dust.
264,7,"but who is he, with modest looks,"
265,7,and clad in homely russet brown?
266,7,he murmurs near the running brooks
267,7,a music sweeter than their own.
268,7,"he is retired as noontide dew,"
269,7,or fountain in a noon-day grove;
270,7,"and you must love him, ere to you"
271,7,he will seem worthy of your love.
272,7,"the outward shows of sky and earth,"
273,7,"of hill and valley, he has viewed;"
274,7,and impulses of deeper birth
275,7,have come to him in solitude.
276,7,in common things that round us lie
277,7,"some random truths he can impart, "
278,7,the harvest of a quiet eye
279,7,that broods and sleeps on his own heart.
280,7,"but he is weak; both man and boy,"
281,7,hath been an idler in the land;
282,7,contented if he might enjoy
283,7,the things which others understand.
284,7, come hither in thy hour of strength;
285,7,"come, weak as is a breaking wave!"
286,7,here stretch thy body at full length;
287,7,or build thy house upon this grave.
288,8,a whirl-blast from behind the hill
289,8,rushed o'er the wood with startling sound;
290,8,"then all at once the air was still,"
291,8,and showers of hailstones pattered round.
292,8,"where leafless oaks towered high above,"
293,8,i sat within an undergrove
294,8,"of tallest hollies, tall and green;"
295,8,a fairer bower was never seen.
296,8,from year to year the spacious floor
297,8,"with withered leaves is covered o'er,"
298,8,and all the year the bower is green.
299,8,but see! where'er the hailstones drop
300,8,the withered leaves all skip and hop;
301,8,there's not a breeze no breath of air 
302,8,"yet here, and there, and everywhere"
303,8,"along the floor, beneath the shade"
304,8,"by those embowering hollies made,"
305,8,"the leaves in myriads jump and spring,"
306,8,as if with pipes and music rare
307,8,"some robin good-fellow were there,"
308,8,"and all those leaves, in festive glee,"
309,8,were dancing to the minstrelsy.
310,9,among the dwellings framed by birds
311,9,"    in field or forest with nice care,"
312,9,is none that with the little wren's
313,9,    in snugness may compare.
314,9,"no door the tenement requires,"
315,9,    and seldom needs a laboured roof;
316,9,yet is it to the fiercest sun
317,9,"    impervious, and storm-proof."
318,9,"so warm, so beautiful withal,"
319,9,"    in perfect fitness for its aim,"
320,9,that to the kind by special grace
321,9,    their instinct surely came.
322,9,and when for their abodes they seek
323,9,"    an opportune recess,"
324,9,the hermit has no finer eye
325,9,    for shadowy quietness.
326,9,"these find, 'mid ivied abbey-walls,"
327,9,    a canopy in some still nook;
328,9,others are pent-housed by a brae
329,9,    that overhangs a brook.
330,9,there to the brooding bird her mate
331,9,    warbles by fits his low clear song;
332,9,and by the busy streamlet both
333,9,    are sung to all day long.
334,9,"or in sequestered lanes they build,"
335,9,"    where, till the flitting bird's return,"
336,9,"her eggs within the nest repose,"
337,9,    like relics in an urn.
338,9,"but still, where general choice is good,"
339,9,    there is a better and a best;
340,9,"and, among fairest objects, some"
341,9,    are fairer than the rest;
342,9,"this, one of those small builders proved"
343,9,"    in a green covert, where, from out"
344,9,"the forehead of a pollard oak,"
345,9,    the leafy antlers sprout;
346,9,"for she who planned the mossy lodge,"
347,9,"    mistrusting her evasive skill,"
348,9,had to a primrose looked for aid
349,9,    her wishes to fulfill.
350,9,"high on the trunk's projecting brow,"
351,9,    and fixed an infant's span above
352,9,"the budding flowers, peeped forth the nest"
353,9,    the prettiest of the grove!
354,9,the treasure proudly did i show
355,9,    to some whose minds without disdain
356,9,can turn to little things; but once
357,9,"    looked up for it in vain,"
358,9,"'tis gone a ruthless spoiler's prey,"
359,9,"    who heeds not beauty, love, or song,"
360,9,'tis gone! so seemed it and we grieved
361,9,    indignant at the wrong.
362,9,"just three days after, passing by"
363,9,    in clearer light the moss-built cell
364,9,"i saw, espied its shaded mouth;"
365,9,    and felt that all was well.
366,9,the primrose for a veil had spread
367,9,    the largest of her upright leaves;
368,9,"and thus, for purposes benign,"
369,9,    a simple flower deceives.
370,9,concealed from friends who might disturb
371,9,"    thy quiet with no ill intent,"
372,9,secure from evil eyes and hands
373,9,"    on barbarous plunder bent,"
374,9,"rest, mother-bird! and when thy young"
375,9,"    take flight, and thou art free to roam,"
376,9,"when withered is the guardian flower,"
377,9,"    and empty thy late home,"
378,9,"think how ye prospered, thou and thine,"
379,9,    amid the unviolated grove
380,9,housed near the growing primrose-tuft
381,9,"    in foresight, or in love."
382,10,".   i thought of thee, my partner and my guide,"
383,10,   as being past away. vain sympathies!
384,10,"   for, backward, duddon! as i cast my eyes,"
385,10,"   i see what was, and is, and will abide;"
386,10,"   still glides the stream, and shall for ever glide;"
387,10,"   the form remains, the function never dies;"
388,10,"   while we, the brave, the mighty, and the wise,"
389,10,"   we men, who in our morn of youth defied"
390,10,"   the elements, must vanish; be it so!"
391,10,"  enough, if something from our hands have power"
392,10,"  to live, and act, and serve the future hour;"
393,10,"  and if, as toward the silent tomb we go,"
394,10,"  through love, through hope, and faith's transcendent dower,"
395,10,  we feel that we are greater than we know.
396,11,i have a boy of five years old;
397,11,his face is fair and fresh to see;
398,11,his limbs are cast in beauty's mold
399,11,and dearly he loves me.
400,11,"one morn we strolled on our dry walk,"
401,11,"or quiet home all full in view,"
402,11,and held such intermitted talk
403,11,as we are wont to do.
404,11,my thoughts on former pleasures ran;
405,11,"i thought of kilve's delightful shore,"
406,11,"our pleasant home when spring began,"
407,11,"a long, long year before."
408,11,a day it was when i could bear
409,11,some fond regrets to entertain;
410,11,"with so much happiness to spare,"
411,11,i could not feel a pain.
412,11,the green earth echoed to the feet
413,11,"of lambs that bounded through the glade,"
414,11,"from shade to sunshine, and as fleet"
415,11,from sunshine back to shade.
416,11,birds warbled round me and each trace
417,11,of inward sadness had its charm;
418,11,"kilve, thought i, was a favoured place,"
419,11,and so is liswyn farm.
420,11,"my boy beside me tripped, so slim"
421,11,and graceful in his rustic dress!
422,11,"and, as we talked, i questioned him,"
423,11,in very idleness.
424,11,"""now tell me, had you rather be,"""
425,11,"i said. and took him by the arm,"
426,11,"""on kilve's smooth shore, by the green sea,"
427,11,"or here at liswyn farm?"""
428,11,"in careless mood he looked at me,"
429,11,"while still i held him by the arm,"
430,11,"and said, ""at kilve i'd rather be"
431,11,"than here at liswyn farm."""
432,11,"""now, little edward, say why so,"
433,11,"my little edward, tell me why."" "
434,11,"""i cannot tell, i do not know."" "
435,11,"""why, this is strange,"" said i;"
436,11,"""for, here are woods, hills smooth and warm,"
437,11,there surely must one reason be
438,11,why you would change sweet liswyn farm
439,11,"for kilve by the green sea."""
440,11,"at this, my boy hung down his head,"
441,11,"he blushed with shame, nor made reply;"
442,11,"and three times to the child i said,"
443,11,"""why, ,edward, tell me why?"""
444,11,"his head he raised there was in sight,"
445,11,"it caught his eye, he saw it plain "
446,11,"upon the house-top, glittering bright,"
447,11,a broad and gilded vane.

465,12,"long patience hath such mild composure given,"

535,15,"  and fear, and bloodshed, miserable train!"
536,15,  turns his necessity to glorious gain;

673,18,  and flowers are on his person thrown
674,18,    in boundless prodigality;
675,18,"  nor doth the general voice abstain from prayer,"

853,21,".  when first, descending from the moorlands,"
854,21,   i saw the stream of yarrow glide
855,21,"   along a bare and open valley,"
856,21,   the ettrick shepherd was my guide.
857,21,"   when last along its banks i wandered,"
858,21,   through groves that had begun to shed
859,21,"   their golden leaves upon the pathways,"
860,21,   my steps the border-minstrel led.
861,21,"   the mighty minstrel breathes no longer,"
862,21,  'mid mouldering ruins low he lies;
863,21,"  and death upon the braes of yarrow,"
864,21,"  has closed the shepherd-poet's eyes,"
865,21,"  nor has the rolling year twice measured,"
866,21,"  from sign to sign, its stedfast course,"
867,21,  since every mortal power of coleridge
868,21,  was frozen at its marvellous source;
869,21,"  the rapt one, of the godlike forehead,"
870,21,"  the heaven-eyed creature sleeps in earth,"
871,21,"  and lamb, the frolic and the gentle,"
872,21,  has vanished from his lonely hearth.
873,21,"  like clouds that rake the mountain-summits,"
874,21,"  or waves that own no curbing hand,"
875,21,"  how fast has brother followed brother,"
876,21,  from sunshine to the sunless land!
877,21,"  yet i, whose lids from infant slumber"
878,21,"  were earlier raised, remain to hear"
879,21,"  a timid voice, that asks in whispers,"
880,21,"  ""who next will drop and disappear?"""
881,21,"  our haughty life is crowned with darkness,"
882,21,"  like london with its own black wreath,"
883,21,"  on which with thee, o crabbe! forth-looking,"
884,21,  i gazed from hampstead's breezy heath.
885,21,"  as if but yesterday departed,"
886,21,"  thou too art gone before; but why,"
887,21,"  o'er ripe fruit, seasonably gathered,"
888,21,  should frail survivors heave a sigh?
889,21,"  mourn rather for that holy spirit,"
890,21,"  sweet as the spring, as ocean deep;"
891,21,"  for her who, ere her summer faded,"
892,21,  has sunk into a breathless sleep.
893,21,"  no more of old romantic sorrows,"
894,21,  for slaughtered youth or love-lorn maid!
895,21,"  with sharper grief is yarrow smitten,"
896,21,  and ettrick mourns with her their poet dead.

903,22,do not touch it! summers two
904,22,"i am older, anne, than you."
905,22,"pull the primrose, sister anne!"
906,22,pull as many as you can.
907,22," here are daisies, take your fill;"
908,22,"pansies, and the cuckoo-flower,"
909,22,of the lofty daffodil
910,22,"make your bed, or make your bower;"
911,22,"fill your lap, and fill your bosom;"
912,22,only spare the strawberry-blossom!
913,22,"primroses, the spring may love them "
914,22,"summer knows but little of them,"
915,22,"violets, a barren kind,"
916,22,withered on the ground must lie;
917,22,daisies leave no fruit behind
918,22,when the pretty flowerets die;
919,22,"pluck them, and another year"
920,22,as many will be blowing here.
921,22,god has given a kindlier power
922,22,to the favoured strawberry-flower.
923,22,hither soon as spring is fled
924,22,you and charles and i will walk;
925,22,"lurking berries, ripe and red,"
926,22,"then will hang on every stalk,"
927,22,each within its leafy bower;
928,22,and for that promise spare the flower!
929,23,i know an aged man constrained to dwell
930,23,"in a large house of public charity,"
931,23,"where he abides, as in a prisoner's cell,"
932,23,"with numbers near, alas! no company."
933,23,"when he could creep about, at will, though poor"
934,23,"and forced to live on alms, this old man fed"
935,23,"a redbreast, one that to his cottage door"
936,23,"came not, but in a lane partook his bread."
937,23,"there, at the root of one particular tree,"
938,23,an easy seat this worn-out labourer found
939,23,while robin pecked the crumbs upon his knee
940,23,"laid one by one, or scattered on the ground."
941,23,"dear intercourse was theirs, day after day;"
942,23,what signs of mutual gladness when they met!
943,23,"think of their common peace, their simple play,"
944,23,the parting moment and its fond regret.
945,23,"months passed in love that failed not to fulfil,"
946,23,"in spite of season's change, its own demand,"
947,23,by fluttering pinions here and busy bill;
948,23,there by caresses from a tremulous hand.
949,23,thus in the chosen spot a tie so strong
950,23,"was formed between the solitary pair,"
951,23,that when his fate had housed him 'mid a throng
952,23,the captive shunned all converse proffered there.
953,23,"wife, children, kindred, they were dead and gone;"
954,23,"but, if no evil hap his wishes crossed,"
955,23,"one living stay was left, and on that one"
956,23,some recompence for all that he had lost.
957,23,"oh that the good old man had power to prove,"
958,23,"by message sent through air or visible token,"
959,23,"that still he loves the bird, and still must love;"
960,23,that friendship lasts though fellowship is broken!
961,24,in calling forth and strengthening the imagination
962,24,in boyhood and early youth
963,24,wisdom and spirit of the universe!
964,24,"thou soul, that art the eternity of thought!"
965,24,and giv'st to forms and images a breath
966,24,"and everlasting motion! not in vain,"
967,24,"by day or star-light, thus from my first dawn"
968,24,of childhood didst thou intertwine for me
969,24,"the passions that build up our human soul,"
970,24,"not with the mean and vulgar works of man,"
971,24,"but with high objects, with enduring things,"
972,24,with life and nature; purifying thus
973,24,"the elements of feeling and of thought,"
974,24,and sanctifying by such discipline
975,24,"both pain and fear, -until we recognize"
976,24,a grandeur in the beatings of the heart.
977,24,nor was this fellowship vouchsafed to me
978,24,"with stinted kindness. in november days,"
979,24,when vapours rolling down the valleys made
980,24,a lonely scene more lonesome; among woods
981,24,"at noon; and mid the calm of summer nights,"
982,24,"when, by the margin of the trembling lake,"
983,24,"beneath the gloomy hills, i homeward went"
984,24,"in solitude, such intercourse was mine,"
985,24,"'twas mine among the fields both day and night,"
986,24,"and by the waters, all the summer long."
987,24,"and in the frosty season, when the sun"
988,24,"was set, and, visible for many a mile,"
989,24,"the cottage windows through the twilight blazed,"
990,24,"i heeded not the summons, -happy time"
991,24,it was indeed for all of us; for me
992,24,it was a time of rapture! -clear and loud
993,24,"the village clock tolled six -i wheeled about,"
994,24,proud and exulting like an untired horse
995,24,that cares not for his home. -all shod with steel
996,24,"we hissed along the polished ice, in games"
997,24,"confederate, imitative of the chase"
998,24,"and woodland pleasures, -the resounding horn,"
999,24,"the pack loud-bellowing, and the hunted hare."
1000,24,"so through the darkness and the cold we flew,"
1001,24,"and not a voice was idle, with the din"
1002,24,meanwhile the precipices rang aloud;
1003,24,the leafless trees and every icy crag
1004,24,tinkled like iron; while the distant hills
1005,24,into the tumult sent an alien sound
1006,24,"of melancholy, not unnoticed, while the stars,"
1007,24,"eastward, were sparkling clear, and in the west"
1008,24,the orange sky of evening died away.
1009,24,not seldom from the uproar i retired
1010,24,"into a silent bay, -or sportively"
1011,24,"glanced sideway, leaving the tumultuous throng,"
1012,24,to cut across the reflex of a star;
1013,24,"image that, flying still before me, gleamed"
1014,24,"upon the glassy plain, and oftentimes,"
1015,24,"when we had given our bodies to the wind,"
1016,24,and all the shadowy banks on either side
1017,24,"came sweeping through the darkness, spinning still"
1018,24,"the rapid line of motion, then at once"
1019,24,"have i, reclining back upon my heels,"
1020,24,stopped short; yet still the solitary cliffs
1021,24,wheeled by me -even as if the earth had rolled
1022,24,with visible motion her diurnal round!
1023,24,"behind me did they stretch in solemn train,"
1024,24,"feebler and feebler, and i stood and watched"
1025,24,till all was tranquil as a summer sea.
1026,25,stranger! this hillock of mis-shapen stones
1027,25,"is not a ruin spared or made by time,"
1028,25,"nor, as perchance thou rashly deem'st, the cairn"
1029,25,"of some old british chief, 'tis nothing more"
1030,25,than the rude embryo of a little dome
1031,25,"or pleasure-house, once destined to be built"
1032,25,among the birch-trees of this rocky isle.
1033,25,"but, as it chanced, sir william having learned"
1034,25,"that from the shore a full-grown man might wade,"
1035,25,and make himself a freeman of this spot
1036,25,"at any hour he chose, the prudent knight"
1037,25,"desisted, and the quarry and the mound"
1038,25,are monuments of his unfinished task.
1039,25,"the block on which these lines are traced, perhaps,"
1040,25,was once selected as the corner-stone
1041,25,"of that intended pile, which would have been"
1042,25,"some quaint odd plaything of elaborate skill,"
1043,25,"so that, i guess, the linnet and the thrush,"
1044,25,"and other little builders who dwell here,"
1045,25,"had wondered at the work. but blame him not,"
1046,25,"for old sir william was a gentle knight,"
1047,25,"bled in this vale, to which he appertained"
1048,25,"with all his ancestry. then peace to him,"
1049,25,and for the outrage which he had devised
1050,25,entire forgiveness! but if thou art one
1051,25,on fire with thy impatience to become
1052,25,"an inmate of these mountains, if, disturbed"
1053,25,"by beautiful conceptions, thou hast hewn"
1054,25,out of the quiet rock the elements
1055,25,of thy trim mansion destined soon to blaze
1056,25,"in snow-white splendour, think again; and, taught"
1057,25,"by old sir william and his quarry, leave"
1058,25,thy fragments to the bramble and the rose;
1059,25,"there let the vernal slow-worm sun himself,"
1060,25,and let the redbreast hop from stone to stone.
1061,26,".   tax not the royal saint with vain expense,"
1062,26,   with ill-matched aims the architect who planned 
1063,26,   albeit labouring for a scanty band
1064,26,   of white-robed scholars only this immense
1065,26,   and glorious work of fine intelligence!
1066,26,   give all thou canst; high heaven rejects the lore
1067,26,   of nicely-calculated less or more;
1068,26,   so deemed the man who fashioned for the sense
1069,26,"   these lofty pillars, spread that branching roof"
1070,26,"  self-poised, and scooped into ten thousand cells,"
1071,26,"  where light and shade repose, where music dwells"
1072,26,  lingering and wandering on as loth to die;
1073,26,  like thoughts whose very sweetness yieldeth proof
1074,26,  that they were born for immortality.
1075,27,"it is a beauteous evening, calm and free,"
1076,27,the holy time is quiet as a nun
1077,27,breathless with adoration; the broad sun
1078,27,is sinking down in its tranquility;
1079,27,"the gentleness of heaven broods o'er the sea,"
1080,27,"listen! the mighty being is awake,"
1081,27,and doth with his eternal motion make
1082,27,a sound like thunder - everlastingly.
1083,27,"dear child! dear girl! that walkest with me here,"
1084,27,"if thou appear untouched by solemn thought,"
1085,27,"thy nature is not therefore less divine,"
1086,27,"thou liest in abraham's bosom all the year,"
1087,27,"and worship'st at the temple's inner shrine,"
1088,27,god being with thee when we know it not.
1089,28,.   it is not to be thought of that the flood
1090,28,"   of british freedom, which, to the open sea"
1091,28,"   of the world's praise, from dark antiquity"
1092,28,"   hath flowed, ""with pomp of waters, unwithstood,"""
1093,28,   roused though it be full often to a mood
1094,28,"   which spurns the check of salutary bands,"
1095,28,   that this most famous stream in bogs and sands
1096,28,   should perish; and to evil and to good
1097,28,   be lost for ever. in our halls is hung
1098,28,"  armoury of the invincible knights of old,"
1099,28,"  we must be free or die, who speak the tongue"
1100,28,  that shakespeare spake; the faith and morals hold
1101,28,  which milton held. in every thing we are sprung
1102,28,"  of earth's first blood, have titles manifold."
1103,29,"it was an april morning, fresh and clear"
1104,29,"the rivulet, delighting in its strength,"
1105,29,ran with a young man's speed; and yet the voice
1106,29,of waters which the winter had supplied
1107,29,was softened down into a vernal tone.
1108,29,"the spirit of enjoyment and desire,"
1109,29,"and hopes and wishes, from all living things"
1110,29,"went circling, like a multitude of sounds."
1111,29,the budding groves seemed eager to urge on
1112,29,the steps of june; as if their various hues
1113,29,were only hindrances that stood between
1114,29,"them and their object, but, meanwhile, prevailed"
1115,29,such an entire contentment in the air
1116,29,"that every naked ash, and tardy tree"
1117,29,"yet leafless, showed as if the countenance"
1118,29,with which it looked on this delightful day
1119,29,were native to the summer. up the brook
1120,29,"i roamed in the confusion of my heart,"
1121,29,alive to all things and forgetting all.
1122,29,at length i to a sudden turning came
1123,29,"in this continuous glen, where down a rock"
1124,29,"the stream, so ardent in its course before,"
1125,29,"sent forth such sallies of glad sound, that all"
1126,29,"which i till then had heard, appeared the voice"
1127,29,"of common pleasure, beast and bird, the lamb,"
1128,29,"the shepherd's dog, the linnet and the thrush"
1129,29,"vied with this waterfall, and made a song,"
1130,29,"which, while i listened, seemed like the wild growth"
1131,29,"or like some natural produce of the air,"
1132,29,that could not cease to be. green leaves were here;
1133,29,"but 'twas the foliage of the rocks the birch,"
1134,29,"the yew, the holly, and the bright green thorn,"
1135,29,"with hanging islands of resplendent furze,"
1136,29,"and, on a summit, distant a short space,"
1137,29,"by any who should look beyond the dell,"
1138,29,a single mountain-cottage might be seen.
1139,29,"i gazed and gazed, and to myself i said,"
1140,29,"""our thoughts at least are ours; and this wild nook,"
1141,29,"my emma, i will dedicate to thee."""
1142,29," -soon did the spot become my other home,"
1143,29,"my dwelling, and my out-of-doors abode."
1144,29,"and, of the shepherds who have seen me there,"
1145,29,to whom i sometimes in our idle talk
1146,29,"have told this fancy, two or three, perhaps,"
1147,29,"years after we are gone and in our graves,"
1148,29,"when they have cause to speak of this wild place,"
1149,29,may call it by the name of emma's dell.
1150,30,smile of the moon! for i so name
1151,30,that silent greeting from above;
1152,30,a gentle flash of light that came
1153,30,from her whom drooping captives love;
1154,30,or art thou of still higher birth?
1155,30,"thou that didst part the clouds of earth,"
1156,30,my torpor to reprove!
1157,30,"bright boon of pitying heaven! alas,"
1158,30,i may not trust thy placid cheer!
1159,30,pondering that time tonight will pass
1160,30,the threshold of another year;
1161,30,for years to me are sad and dull;
1162,30,my very moments are too full
1163,30,of hopelessness and fear.
1164,30,"and yet, the soul-awakening gleam,"
1165,30,that struck perchance the farthest cone
1166,30,"of scotland's rocky wilds, did seem"
1167,30,"to visit me, and me alone;"
1168,30,"me, unapproached by any friend,"
1169,30,save those who to my sorrow lend
1170,30,tears due unto their own.
1171,30,to night the church-tower bells will ring
1172,30,through these wide realms a festire peal;
1173,30,to the new year a welcoming;
1174,30,a tuneful offering for the weal
1175,30,of happy millions lulled in deep;
1176,30,"while i am forced to watch and weep,"
1177,30,by wounds that may not heal.
1178,30,"born all too high, by wedlock raised"
1179,30,still higherñto be cast thus low!
1180,30,would that mine eyes had never gazed
1181,30,on aught of more ambitious show
1182,30,than the sweet flowerets of the fields
1183,30, it is my royal state that yields
1184,30,this bitterness of woe.
1185,30,"yet how? for i, if there be truth"
1186,30,"in the world's voice, was passing fair;"
1187,30,"and beauty, for confiding youth,"
1188,30,those shocks of passion can prepare
1189,30,that kill the bloom before its time;
1190,30,"and blanch, without the owner's crime,"
1191,30,the most resplendent hair.
1192,30,unblest distinction! showered on me
1193,30,"to bind a lingering life in chains,"
1194,30,"all that could quit my grasp, or flee,"
1195,30,is gone; but not the subtle stains
1196,30,fixed in the spirit; for even here
1197,30,can i be proud that jealous fear
1198,30,of what i was remains.
1199,30,a woman rules my prison's key;
1200,30,"a sister queen, against the bent"
1201,30,"o£ law and holiest sympathy,"
1202,30,"detains me, doubtful of the event;"
1203,30,"great god, who feel'st for my distress,"
1204,30,"my thoughts are all that i possess,"
1205,30,o keep them innocent!
1206,30,"farewell desire of human aid,"
1207,30,which abject mortals vainly court!
1208,30,"by friends deceived, by foes betrayed,"
1209,30,"of fears the prey, of hopes the sport;"
1210,30,nought but the world-redeeming cross
1211,30,"is able to support my loss,"
1212,30,my burthen to support.
1213,30,hark! the death-note of the year
1214,30,sounded by the castle-clock!
1215,30,from her sunk eyes a stagnant tear
1216,30,"stole forth, unsettled by the shock;"
1217,30,"but oft the woods renewed their green,"
1218,30,ere the tired head of scotland's queen
1219,30,reposed upon the block!
1220,31,".  ""with sacrifice before the rising morn"

1222,31,"   and from the infernal gods, 'mid shades forlorn"
1223,31,"   of night, my slaughtered lord have i required,"
1224,31,   celestial pity i again implore; 
1225,31,"   restore him to my sight great jove, restore!"""
1226,31,"   so speaking, and by fervent love endowed"
1227,31,"   with faith, the suppliant heavenward lifts her hands;"
1228,31,"   while, like the sun emerging from a cloud,"
1229,31,  her countenance brightens and her eye expands;
1230,31,"  her bosom heaves and spreads, her stature grows;"
1231,31,  as she expects the issue in repose.
1232,31,  o terror! what hath she perceived? o joy!
1233,31,  what doth she look on? whom doth she behold?
1234,31,  her hero slain upon the beach of troy?
1235,31,  his vital presence? his corporeal mould?
1236,31,  it is if sense deceive her not 'tis he!
1237,31,"  and a god leads him, wingèd mercury!"
1238,31,  mild hermes spake and touched her with his wand
1239,31,"  that calms all fear; ""such grace hath crowned thy prayer,"
1240,31,  laodamía! that at jove's command
1241,31,"  thy husband walks the paths of upper air,"
1242,31,  he comes to tarry with thee three hours' space;
1243,31,"  accept the gift, behold him face to face!"""
1244,31,  forth sprang the impassioned queen her lord to clasp;
1245,31,  again that consummation she essayed;
1246,31,  but unsubstantial form eludes her grasp
1247,31,  as often as that eager grasp was made.
1248,31,"  the phantom parts but parts to re-unite,"
1249,31,  and re-assume his place before her sight.
1250,31,"  ""protesiláus, lo! thy guide is gone!"

1374,31," swift, toward the realms that know not earthly day,"

1377,31," thus, all in vain exhorted and reproved,"
1378,31," she perished; and, as for a wilful crime,"
1379,31," by the just gods whom no weak pity moved,"
1380,31," was doomed to wear out her appointed time,"
1381,31," apart from happy ghosts, that gather flowers"

1384,31, and mortal hopes defeated and o'erthrown

1386,31, as fondly he believes. upon the side
1387,31, of hellespont such faith was entertained
1388,31, a knot of spiry trees for ages grew
1389,31, from out the tomb of him for whom she died;
1390,31," and ever, when such stature they had gained"
1391,31," that ilium's walls were subject to their view,"
1392,31, the trees' tall summits withered at the sight;
1393,31, a constant interchange of growth and blight!
1394,32,"five years have past; five summers, with the length"
1395,32,of five long winters! and again i hear
1396,32,"these waters, rolling from their mountain-springs"
1397,32,with a soft inland murmur. once again
1398,32,"do i behold these steep and lofty cliffs,"
1399,32,that on a wild secluded scene impress
1400,32,thoughts of more deep seclusion; and connect
1401,32,the landscape with the quiet of the sky.
1402,32,the day is come when i again repose
1403,32,"here, under this dark sycamore, and view"
1404,32,"these plots of cottage-ground, these orchard-tufts,"
1405,32,"which at this season, with their unripe fruits,"
1406,32,"are clad in one green hue, and lose themselves"
1407,32,'mid groves and copses. once again i see
1408,32,"these hedge-rows, hardly hedge-rows, little lines"
1409,32,"of sportive wood run wild, these pastoral farms,"
1410,32,green to the very door; and wreaths of smoke
1411,32,"sent up, in silence, from among the trees!"
1412,32,"with some uncertain notice, as might seem"
1413,32,"of vagrant dwellers in the houseless woods,"
1414,32,"or of some hermit's cave, where by his fire"
1415,32,"the hermit sits alone. these beauteous forms,"
1416,32,"through a long absence, have not been to me"
1417,32,"as is a landscape to a blind man's eye,"
1418,32,"but oft, in lonely rooms, and 'mid the din"
1419,32,"of towns and cities, i have owed to them"
1420,32,"in hours of weariness, sensations sweet,"
1421,32,"felt in the blood, and felt along the heart;"
1422,32,"and passing even into my purer mind,"
1423,32,"with tranquil restoration, feelings too"
1424,32,"of unremembered pleasure, such, perhaps,"
1425,32,as have no slight or trivial influence
1426,32,"on that best portion of a good man's life,"
1427,32,"his little, nameless, unremembered, acts"
1428,32,"of kindness and of love. nor less, i trust,"
1429,32,"to them i may have owed another gift,"
1430,32,"of aspect more sublime; that blessed mood,"
1431,32,"in which the burthen of the mystery,"
1432,32,in which the heavy and the weary weight
1433,32,"of all this unintelligible world,"
1434,32,"is lightened, that serene and blessed mood,"
1435,32,"in which the affections gently lead us on, "
1436,32,"until, the breath of this corporeal frame"
1437,32,and even the motion of our human blood
1438,32,"almost suspended, we are laid asleep"
1439,32,"in body, and become a living soul,"
1440,32,while with an eye made quiet by the power
1441,32,"of harmony, and the deep power of joy,"
1442,32,we see into the life of things. if this
1443,32,"be but a vain belief, yet, oh! how oft "
1444,32,in darkness and amid the many shapes
1445,32,of joyless daylight; when the fretful stir
1446,32,"unprofitable, and the fever of the world,"
1447,32,have hung upon the beatings of my heart 
1448,32,"how oft, in spirit, have i turned to thee,"
1449,32,"o sylvan wye! thou wanderer thro' the woods,"
1450,32,how often has my spirit turned to thee!
1451,32,"and now, with gleams of half-extinguished thought,"
1452,32,"with many recognitions dim and faint,"
1453,32,"and somewhat of a sad perplexity,"
1454,32,"the picture of the mind revives again,"
1455,32,"while here i stand, not only with the sense"
1456,32,"of present pleasure, but with pleasing thoughts"
1457,32,that in this moment there is life and food
1458,32,"for future years. and so i dare to hope,"
1459,32,"though changed, no doubt, from what i was when first"
1460,32,i came among these hills; when like a roe
1461,32,"i bounded o'er the mountains, by the sides"
1462,32,"of the deep rivers, and the lonely streams,"
1463,32,"wherever nature led, more like a man"
1464,32,"flying from something that he dreads, than one"
1465,32,who sought the thing he loved. for nature then
1466,32,"the coarser pleasures of my boyish days,"
1467,32,and their glad animal movements all gone by
1468,32,to me was all in all. i cannot paint
1469,32,what then i was. the sounding cataract
1470,32,"haunted me like a passion, the tall rock,"
1471,32,"the mountain, and the deep and gloomy wood,"
1472,32,"their colours and their forms, were then to me"
1473,32,"an appetite; a feeling and a love,"
1474,32,"that had no need of a remoter charm,"
1475,32,"by thought supplied, nor any interest"
1476,32,"unborrowed from the eye. that time is past,"
1477,32,"and all its aching joys are now no more,"
1478,32,and all its dizzy raptures. not for this
1479,32,"faint i, nor mourn nor murmur, other gifts"
1480,32,"have followed; for such loss, i would believe,"
1481,32,abundant recompence. for i have learned
1482,32,"to look on nature, not as in the hour"
1483,32,of thoughtless youth; but hearing oftentimes
1484,32,"the still, sad music of humanity,"
1485,32,"nor harsh nor grating, though of ample power"
1486,32,to chasten and subdue. and i have felt
1487,32,a presence that disturbs me with the joy
1488,32,of elevated thoughts; a sense sublime
1489,32,"of something far more deeply interfused,"
1490,32,"whose dwelling is the light of setting suns,"
1491,32,"and the round ocean and the living air,"
1492,32,"and the blue sky, and in the mind of man;"
1493,32,"a motion and a spirit, that impels"
1494,32,"all thinking things, all objects of all thought,"
1495,32,and rolls through all things. therefore am i still
1496,32,"a lover of the meadows and the woods,"
1497,32,and mountains; and of all that we behold
1498,32,from this green earth; of all the mighty world
1499,32,"of eye, and ear, both what they half create,"
1500,32,and what perceive; well pleased to recognise
1501,32,"in nature and the language of the sense,"
1502,32,"the anchor of my purest thoughts, the nurse,"
1503,32,"the guide, the guardian of my heart, and soul"
1504,32,"of all my moral being. nor perchance,"
1505,32,"if i were not thus taught, should i the more"
1506,32,"suffer my genial spirits to decay,"
1507,32,for thou art with me here upon the banks
1508,32,"of this fair river; thou my dearest friend,"
1509,32,"my dear, dear friend; and in thy voice i catch"
1510,32,"the language of my former heart, and read"
1511,32,my former pleasures in the shooting lights
1512,32,of thy wild eyes. oh! yet a little while
1513,32,"may i behold in thee what i was once,"
1514,32,"my dear, dear sister! and this prayer i make,"
1515,32,knowing that nature never did betray
1516,32,"the heart that loved her; 'tis her privilege,"
1517,32,"through all the years of this our life, to lead"
1518,32,"from joy to joy, for she can so inform"
1519,32,"the mind that is within us, so impress"
1520,32,"with quietness and beauty, and so feed"
1521,32,"with lofty thoughts, that neither evil tongues,"
1522,32,"rash judgments, nor the sneers of selfish men,"
1523,32,"nor greetings where no kindness is, nor all"
1524,32,"the dreary intercourse of daily life,"
1525,32,"shall e'er prevail against us, or disturb"
1526,32,"our cheerful faith, that all which we behold"
1527,32,is full of blessings. therefore let the moon
1528,32,shine on thee in thy solitary walk;
1529,32,and let the misty mountain-winds be free
1530,32,"to blow against thee, and, in after years,"
1531,32,when these wild ecstasies shall be matured
1532,32,into a sober pleasure; when thy mind
1533,32,"shall be a mansion for all lovely forms,"
1534,32,thy memory be as a dwelling-place
1535,32,"for all sweet sounds and harmonies; oh! then,"
1536,32,"if solitude, or fear, or pain, or grief,"
1537,32,"should be thy portion, with what healing thoughts"
1538,32,"of tender joy wilt thou remember me,"
1539,32,"and these my exhortations! nor, perchance "
1540,32,if i should be where i no more can hear
1541,32,"thy voice, nor catch from thy wild eyes these gleams"
1542,32,of past existence wilt thou then forget
1543,32,that on the banks of this delightful stream
1544,32,"we stood together; and that i, so long"
1545,32,"a worshipper of nature, hither came"
1546,32,"unwearied in that service, rather say"
1547,32,with warmer love oh! with far deeper zeal
1548,32,"of holier love. nor wilt thou then forget,"
1549,32,"that after many wanderings, many years"
1550,32,"of absence, these steep woods and lofty cliffs,"
1551,32,"and this green pastoral landscape, were to me"
1552,32,"more dear, both for themselves and for thy sake!"
1553,33,"i heard a thousand blended notes,"
1554,33,"while in a grove i sate reclined,"
1555,33,in that sweet mood when pleasant thoughts
1556,33,bring sad thoughts to the mind.
1557,33,to her fair works did nature link
1558,33,the human soul that through me ran;
1559,33,and much it grieved my heart to think
1560,33,what man has made of man.
1561,33,"through primrose tufts, in that green bower,"
1562,33,the periwinkle trailed its wreaths;
1563,33,and 'tis my faith that every flower
1564,33,enjoys the air it breathes.
1565,33,"the birds around me hopped and played,"
1566,33,"their thoughts i cannot measure, "
1567,33,"but the least motion which they made,"
1568,33,it seemed a thrill of pleasure.
1569,33,"the budding twigs spread out their fan,"
1570,33,to catch the breezy air;
1571,33,"and i must think, do all i can,"
1572,33,that there was pleasure there.
1573,33,"if this belief from heaven be sent,"
1574,33,"if such be nature's holy plan,"
1575,33,have i not reason to lament
1576,33,what man has made of man?
1577,34,"milton! thou shouldst be living at this hour,"
1578,34,"england hath need of thee, she is a fen"
1579,34,"of stagnant waters, altar, sword, and pen,"
1580,34,"fireside, the heroic wealth of hall and bower,"
1581,34,have forfeited their ancient english dower
1582,34,of inward happiness. we are selfish men;
1583,34,"oh! raise us up, return to us again;"
1584,34,"and give us manners, virtue, freedom, power."
1585,34,"thy soul was like a star, and dwelt apart,"
1586,34,"thou hadst a voice whose sound was like the sea,"
1587,34,"pure as the naked heavens, majestic, free,"
1588,34,"so didst thou travel on life's common way,"
1589,34,in cheerful godliness; and yet the heart
1590,34,the lowliest duties on herself did lay.
1591,35,"oft i had heard of lucy gray,"
1592,35,"and when i cross'd the wild,"
1593,35,i chanc'd to see at break of day
1594,35,the solitary child.
1595,35,"no mate, no comrade lucy knew;"
1596,35,"she dwelt on a wild moor,"
1597,35,the sweetest thing that ever grew
1598,35,beside a human door!
1599,35,"you yet may spy the fawn at play,"
1600,35,the hare upon the green;
1601,35,but the sweet face of lucy gray
1602,35,will never more be seen.
1603,35,"""to-night will be a stormy night,"
1604,35,"you to the town must go,"
1605,35,"and take a lantern, child, to light"
1606,35,"your mother thro' the snow."""
1607,35,"""that, father! will i gladly do;"
1608,35,'tis scarcely afternoon 
1609,35,"the minster-clock has just struck two,"
1610,35,"and yonder is the moon."""
1611,35,at this the father rais'd his hook
1612,35,and snapp'd a faggot-band;
1613,35,"he plied his work, and lucy took"
1614,35,the lantern in her hand.
1615,35,"not blither is the mountain roe,"
1616,35,with many a wanton stroke
1617,35,"her feet disperse, the powd'ry snow"
1618,35,that rises up like smoke.
1619,35,"the storm came on before its time,"
1620,35,"she wander'd up and down,"
1621,35,and many a hill did lucy climb
1622,35,but never reach'd the town.
1623,35,the wretched parents all that night
1624,35,went shouting far and wide;
1625,35,but there was neither sound nor sight
1626,35,to serve them for a guide.
1627,35,at day-break on a hill they stood
1628,35,that overlook'd the moor;
1629,35,and thence they saw the bridge of wood
1630,35,a furlong from their door.
1631,35,"and now they homeward turn'd, and cry'd"
1632,35,"""in heaven we all shall meet!"""
1633,35,when in the snow the mother spied
1634,35,the print of lucy's feet.
1635,35,then downward from the steep hill's edge
1636,35,they track'd the footmarks small;
1637,35,"and through the broken hawthorn-hedge,"
1638,35,and by the long stone-wall;
1639,35,"and then an open field they cross'd,"
1640,35,the marks were still the same;
1641,35,"they track'd them on, nor ever lost,"
1642,35,and to the bridge they came.
1643,35,they follow'd from the snowy bank
1644,35,"the footmarks, one by one,"
1645,35,"into the middle of the plank,"
1646,35,and further there were none.
1647,35,yet some maintain that to this day
1648,35,"she is a living child,"
1649,35,that you may see sweet lucy gray
1650,35,upon the lonesome wild.
1651,35,"o'er rough and smooth she trips along,"
1652,35,and never looks behind;
1653,35,and sings a solitary song
1654,35,that whistles in the wind.
1655,36,"strange fits of passion have i known,"
1656,36,"and i will dare to tell,"
1657,36,"but in the lover's ear alone,"
1658,36,what once to me befell.
1659,36,when she i loved looked every day
1660,36,"fresh as a rose in june,"
1661,36,"i to her cottage bent my way,"
1662,36,beneath an evening-moon.
1663,36,"upon the moon i fixed my eye,"
1664,36,all over the wide lea;
1665,36,with quickening pace my horse drew nigh
1666,36,those paths so dear to me.
1667,36,and now we reached the orchard-plot;
1668,36,"and, as we climbed the hill,"
1669,36,the sinking moon to lucy's cot
1670,36,"came near, and nearer still."
1671,36,"in one of those sweet dreams i slept,"
1672,36,kind nature's gentlest boon!
1673,36,and all the while my eye i kept
1674,36,on the descending moon.
1675,36,my horse moved on; hoof after hoof
1676,36,"he raised, and never stopped,"
1677,36,"when down behind the cottage roof,"
1678,36,"at once, the bright moon dropped."
1679,36,what fond and wayward thoughts will slide
1680,36,into a lover's head!
1681,36,"""o mercy!"" to myself i cried,"
1682,36,"""if lucy should be dead!"""
1683,37,she dwelt among the untrodden ways
1684,37,"    beside the springs of dove,"
1685,37,maid whom there were none to praise
1686,37,"    and very few to love,"
1687,37,a violet by a mossy stone
1688,37,    half hidden from the eye!
1689,37," fair as a star, when only one"
1690,37,    is shining in the sky.
1691,37,"she lived unknown, and few could know"
1692,37,    when lucy ceased to be;
1693,37,"but she is in her grave, and, oh,"
1694,37,    the difference to me!
1695,38,a slumber did my spirit seal;
1696,38,"    i had no human fears,"
1697,38,she seemed a thing that could not feel
1698,38,    the touch of earthly years.
1699,38,"no motion has she now, no force;"
1700,38,    she neither hears nor sees;
1701,38,"rolled round in earth's diurnal course,"
1702,38,"    with rocks, and stones, and trees."
1703,39,"i travelled among unknown men,"
1704,39,       in lands beyond the sea;
1705,39,"nor, england! did i know till then"
1706,39,       what love i bore to thee.
1707,39,"'tis past, that melancholy dream!"
1708,39,       nor will i quit thy shore
1709,39,a second time; for still i seem
1710,39,       to love thee more and more.
1711,39,among thy mountains did i feel
1712,39,      the joy of my desire;
1713,39,and she i cherished turned her wheel
1714,39,      beside an english fire.
1715,39,"thy mornings showed, thy nights concealed,"
1716,39,      the bowers where lucy played;
1717,39,and thine too is the last green field
1718,39,      that lucy's eyes surveyed.
1719,40,"three years she grew in sun and shower,"
1720,40,"then nature said, ""a lovelier flower"
1721,40,on earth was never sown;
1722,40,this child i to myself will take;
1723,40,"she shall be mine, and i will make"
1724,40,a lady of my own.
1725,40,"""myself will to my darling be"
1726,40,"both law and impulse, and with me"
1727,40,"the girl, in rock and plain"
1728,40,"in earth and heaven, in glade and bower,"
1729,40,shall feel an overseeing power
1730,40,to kindle or restrain.
1731,40,"""she shall be sportive as the fawn"
1732,40,that wild with glee across the lawn
1733,40,or up the mountain springs;
1734,40,"and her's shall be the breathing balm,"
1735,40,and her's the silence and the calm
1736,40,of mute insensate things.
1737,40,"""the floating clouds their state shall lend"
1738,40,to her; for her the willow bend;
1739,40,nor shall she fail to see
1740,40,even in the motions of the storm
1741,40,grace that shall mold the maiden's form
1742,40,by silent sympathy.
1743,40,"""the stars of midnight shall be dear"
1744,40,to her; and she shall lean her ear
1745,40,in many a secret place
1746,40,"where rivulets dance their wayward round,"
1747,40,and beauty born of murmuring sound
1748,40,shall pass into her face.
1749,40,"""and vital feelings of delight"
1750,40,"shall rear her form to stately height,"
1751,40,her virgin bosom swell;
1752,40,such thoughts to lucy i will give
1753,40,while she and i together live
1754,40,"here in this happy dell."""
1755,40,thus nature spake the work was done 
1756,40,how soon my lucy's race was run!
1757,40,"she died, and left to me"
1758,40,"this heath, this calm, and quiet scene;"
1759,40,"the memory of what has been,"
1760,40,and never more will be.
1761,41,a pen to register; a key 
1762,41,that winds through secret wards
1763,41,are well assigned to memory
1764,41,by allegoric bards.
1765,41,"as aptly, also, might be given"
1766,41,a pencil to her hand;
1767,41,"that, softening objects, sometimes even"
1768,41,outstrips the heart's demand;
1769,41,"that smooths foregone distress, the lines"
1770,41,"of lingering care subdues,"
1771,41,"long-vanished happiness refines,"
1772,41,and clothes in brighter hues;
1773,41,"yet, like a tool of fancy, works"
1774,41,those spectres to dilate
1775,41,"that startle conscience, as she lurks"
1776,41,within her lonely seat.
1777,41,"oh! that our lives, which flee so fast,"
1778,41,"in purity were such,"
1779,41,that not an image of the past
1780,41,should fear that pencil's touch!
1781,41,retirement then might hourly look
1782,41,"upon a soothing scene,"
1783,41,age steal to his allotted nook
1784,41,contented and serene;
1785,41,"with heart as calm as lakes that sleep,"
1786,41,in frosty moonlight glistening;
1787,41,"or mountain rivers, where they creep"
1788,41,"along a channel smooth and deep,"
1789,41,to their own far-off murmurs listening.
1790,42,.  if from the public way you turn your steps
1791,42,"   up the tumultuous brook of green-head ghyll,"
1792,42,   you will suppose that with an upright path
1793,42,   your feet must struggle; in such bold ascent
1794,42,"   the pastoral mountains front you, face to face."
1795,42,"   but, courage! for around that boisterous brook"
1796,42,"   the mountains have all opened out themselves,"
1797,42,   and made a hidden valley of their own.
1798,42,   no habitation can be seen; but they
1799,42,  who journey thither find themselves alone
1800,42,"  with a few sheep, with rocks and stones, and kites"
1801,42,  that overhead are sailing in the sky.
1802,42,  it is in truth an utter solitude;
1803,42,  nor should i have made mention of this dell
1804,42,"  but for one object which you might pass by,"
1805,42,  might see and notice not. beside the brook
1806,42,  appears a straggling heap of unhewn stones!
1807,42,  and to that simple object appertains
1808,42,"  a story unenriched with strange events,"
1809,42,"  yet not unfit, i deem, for the fireside,"
1810,42,  or for the summer shade. it was the first
1811,42,  of those domestic tales that spake to me
1812,42,"  of shepherds, dwellers in the valleys, men"
1813,42,  whom i already loved; not verily
1814,42,"  for their own sakes, but for the fields and hills"
1815,42,  where was their occupation and abode.
1816,42,"  and hence this tale, while i was yet a boy"
1817,42,"  careless of books, yet having felt the power"
1818,42,"  of nature, by the gentle agency"
1819,42,"  of natural objects, led me on to feel"
1820,42,"  for passions that were not my own, and think"
1821,42,  at random and imperfectly indeed
1822,42,"  on man, the heart of man, and human life."
1823,42,"  therefore, although it be a history"
1824,42,"  homely and rude, i will relate the same"
1825,42,  for the delight of a few natural hearts;
1826,42,"  and, with yet fonder feeling, for the sake"
1827,42,"  of youthful poets, who among these hills"
1828,42,  will be my second self when i am gone.
1829,42,      upon the forest-side in grasmere vale
1830,42,"  there dwelt a shepherd, michael was his name;"
1831,42,"  an old man, stout of heart, and strong of limb."
1832,42,  his bodily frame had been from youth to age
1833,42,"  of an unusual strength, his mind was keen,"
1834,42,"  intense, and frugal, apt for all affairs,"
1835,42,  and in his shepherd's calling he was prompt
1836,42,  and watchful more than ordinary men.
1837,42,"  hence had he learned the meaning of all winds,"
1838,42,"  of blasts of every tone; and oftentimes,"
1839,42,"  when others heeded not, he heard the south"
1840,42,"  make subterraneous music, like the noise"
1841,42,  of bagpipers on distant highland hills.
1842,42,"  the shepherd, at such warning, of his flock"
1843,42,"  bethought him, and he to himself would say,"
1844,42,"  ""the winds are now devising work for me!"""
1845,42,"  and, truly, at all times, the storm, that drives"
1846,42,"  the traveller to a shelter, summoned him"
1847,42,"  up to the mountains, he had been alone"
1848,42,"  amid the heart of many thousand mists,"
1849,42,"   that came to him, and left him, on the heights."
1850,42,  so lived he till his eightieth year was past.
1851,42,"  and grossly that man errs, who should suppose"
1852,42,"  that the green valleys, and the streams and rocks,"
1853,42,  were things indifferent to the shepherd's thoughts.
1854,42,"  fields, where with cheerful spirits he had breathed"
1855,42,"  the common air; hills, which with vigorous step"
1856,42,  he had so often climbed; which had impressed
1857,42,  so many incidents upon his mind
1858,42,"  of hardship, skill or courage, joy or fear;"
1859,42,"  which, like a book, preserved the memory"
1860,42,"  of the dumb animals, whom he had saved,"
1861,42,"  had fed or sheltered, linking to such acts"
1862,42,  the certainty of honourable gain;
1863,42,"  those fields, those hills what could they less? had laid"
1864,42,"  strong hold on his affections, were to him"
1865,42,"  a pleasurable feeling of blind love,"
1866,42,  the pleasure which there is in life itself .
1867,42,      his days had not been passed in singleness.
1868,42,"  his helpmate was a comely matron, old "
1869,42,  though younger than himself full twenty years.
1870,42,"  she was a woman of a stirring life,"
1871,42,"  whose heart was in her house, two wheels she had"
1872,42,"  of antique form; this large, for spinning wool;"
1873,42,"  that small, for flax; and, if one wheel had rest,"
1874,42,  it was because the other was at work.
1875,42,"  the pair had but one inmate in their house,"
1876,42,"  an only child, who had been born to them"
1877,42,"  when michael, telling o'er his years, began"
1878,42,"  to deem that he was old, in shepherd's phrase,"
1879,42,"  with one foot in the grave. this only son,"
1880,42,"  with two brave sheep-dogs tried in many a storm,"
1881,42,"  the one of an inestimable worth,"
1882,42,"  made all their household. i may truly say,"
1883,42,  that they were as a proverb in the vale
1884,42,"  for endless industry. when day was gone,"
1885,42,  and from their occupations out of doors
1886,42,"  the son and father were come home, even then,"
1887,42,  their labour did not cease; unless when all
1888,42,"  turned to the cleanly supper-board, and there,"
1889,42," each with a mess of pottage and skimmed milk,"
1890,42," sat round the basket piled with oaten cakes,"
1891,42, and their plain home-made cheese. yet when the meal
1892,42," was ended, luke for so the son was named"
1893,42, and his old father both betook themselves
1894,42, to such convenient work as might employ
1895,42, their hands by the fireside; perhaps to card
1896,42," wool for the housewife's spindle, or repair"
1897,42," some injury done to sickle, flail, or scythe,"
1898,42, or other implement of house or field.
1899,42,"    down from the ceiling, by the chimney's edge,"
1900,42, that in our ancient uncouth country style
1901,42, with huge and black projection overbrowed
1902,42," large space beneath, as duly as the light"
1903,42," of day grew dim the housewife hung a lamp,"
1904,42," an aged utensil, which had performed"
1905,42, service beyond all others of its kind.
1906,42," early at evening did it burn and late,"
1907,42," surviving comrade of uncounted hours,"
1908,42," which, going by from year to year, had found,"
1909,42, and left the couple neither gay perhaps
1910,42," nor cheerful, yet with objects and with hopes,"
1911,42, living a life of eager industry.
1912,42," and now, when luke had reached his eighteenth year,"
1913,42," there by the light of this old lamp they sate,"
1914,42," father and son, while far into the night"
1915,42," the housewife plied her own peculiar work,"
1916,42, making the cottage through the silent hours
1917,42, murmur as with the sound of summer flies.
1918,42," this light was famous in its neighbourhood,"
1919,42, and was a public symbol of the life
1920,42," that thrifty pair had lived. for, as it chanced,"
1921,42, their cottage on a plot of rising ground
1922,42," stood single, with large prospect, north and south,"
1923,42," high into easedale, up to dunmail-raise,"
1924,42, and westward to the village near the lake;
1925,42," and from this constant light, so regular"
1926,42," and so far seen, the house itself, by all"
1927,42," who dwelt within the limits of the vale,"
1928,42," both old and young, was named the evening star."
1929,42,"    thus living on through such a length of years,"
1930,42," the shepherd, if he loved himself, must needs"
1931,42, have loved his helpmate; but to michael's heart
1932,42, this son of his old age was yet more dear 
1933,42," less from instinctive tenderness, the same"
1934,42, fond spirit that blindly works in the blood of all 
1935,42," than that a child, more than all other gifts"
1936,42," that earth can offer to declining man,"
1937,42," brings hope with it, and forward-looking thoughts,"
1938,42," and stirrings of inquietude, when they"
1939,42, by tendency of nature needs must fail.
1940,42," exceeding was the love he bare to him,"
1941,42, his heart and his heart's joy! for oftentimes
1942,42," old michael, while he was a babe in arms,"
1943,42," had done him female service, not alone"
1944,42," for pastime and delight, as is the use"
1945,42," of fathers, but with patient mind enforced"
1946,42, to acts of tenderness; and he had rocked
1947,42," his cradle, as with a woman's gentle hand."
1948,42,"    and, in a later time, ere yet the boy"
1949,42," had put on boy's attire, did michael love,"
1950,42," albeit of a stern unbending mind,"
1951,42," to have the young-one in his sight, when he"
1952,42," wrought in the field, or on his shepherd's stool"
1953,42, sate with a fettered sheep before him stretched
1954,42," under the large old oak, that near his door"
1955,42," stood single, and, from matchless depth of shade,"
1956,42," chosen for the shearer's covert from the sun,"
1957,42, thence in our rustic dialect was called
1958,42," the clipping tree, a name which yet it bears."
1959,42," there, while they two were sitting in the shade,"
1960,42," with others round them, earnest all and blithe,"
1961,42, would michael exercise his heart with looks
1962,42, of fond correction and reproof bestowed
1963,42," upon the child, if he disturbed the sheep"
1964,42," by catching at their legs, or with his shouts"
1965,42," scared them, while they lay still beneath the shears."
1966,42,    and when by heaven's good grace the boy grew up
1967,42," a healthy lad, and carried in his cheek"
1968,42, two steady roses that were five years old;
1969,42, then michael from a winter coppice cut
1970,42," with his own hand a sapling, which he hooped"
1971,42," with iron, making it throughout in all"
1972,42," due requisites a perfect shepherd's staff,"
1973,42, and gave it to the boy; wherewith equipt
1974,42, he as a watchman oftentimes was placed
1975,42," at gate or gap, to stem or turn the flock;"
1976,42," and, to his office prematurely called,"
1977,42," there stood the urchin, as you will divine,"
1978,42," something between a hindrance and a help,"
1979,42," and for this cause not always, i believe,"
1980,42, receiving from his father hire of praise;
1981,42," though nought was left undone which staff, or voice,"
1982,42," or looks, or threatening gestures, could perform."
1983,42,"    but soon as luke, full ten years old, could stand"
1984,42," against the mountain blasts; and to the heights,"
1985,42," not fearing toil, nor length of weary ways,"
1986,42," he with his father daily went, and they"
1987,42," were as companions, why should i relate"
1988,42, that objects which the shepherd loved before
1989,42, were dearer now? that from the boy there came
1990,42, feelings and emanations things which were
1991,42, light to the sun and music to the wind;
1992,42, and that the old man's heart seemed born again?
1993,42,"    thus in his father's sight the boy grew up,"
1994,42," and now, when he had reached his eighteenth year,"
1995,42, he was his comfort and his daily hope.
1996,42,    while in this sort the simple household lived
1997,42," from day to day, to michael's ear there came"
1998,42, distressful tidings. long before the time
1999,42," of which i speak, the shepherd had been bound"
2000,42," in surety for his brother's son, a man"
2001,42," of an industrious life, and ample means;"
2002,42, but unforeseen misfortunes suddenly
2003,42, had prest upon him; and old michael now
2004,42," was summoned to discharge the forfeiture,"
2005,42," a grievous penalty, but little less"
2006,42, than half his substance. this unlooked-for claim
2007,42," at the first hearing, for a moment took"
2008,42, more hope out of his life than he supposed
2009,42, that any old man ever could have lost.
2010,42, as soon as he had armed himself with strength
2011,42," to look his trouble in the face, it seemed"
2012,42, the shepherd's sole resource to sell at once
2013,42, a portion of his patrimonial fields.
2014,42," such was his first resolve; he thought again,"
2015,42," and his heart failed him. ""isabel,"" said he,"
2016,42," two evenings after he had heard the news,"
2017,42," ""i have been toiling more than seventy years,"
2018,42, and in the open sunshine of god's love
2019,42," have we all lived; yet, if these fields of ours"
2020,42," should pass into a stranger's hand, i think"
2021,42, that i could not lie quiet in my grave.
2022,42, our lot is a hard lot; the sun himself
2023,42, has scarcely been more diligent than i;
2024,42, and i have lived to be a fool at last
2025,42, to my own family. an evil man
2026,42," that was, and made an evil choice, if he"
2027,42," were false to us; and, if he were not false,"
2028,42, there are ten thousand to whom loss like this
2029,42, had been no sorrow. i forgive him; but
2030,42, 'twere better to be dumb than to talk thus.
2031,42,"    ""when i began, my purpose was to speak"
2032,42, of remedies and of a cheerful hope.
2033,42," our luke shall leave us, isabel; the land"
2034,42," shall not go from us, and it shall be free;"
2035,42," he shall possess it, free as is the wind"
2036,42," that passes over it. we have, thou know'st,"
2037,42, another kinsman he will be our friend
2038,42," in this distress. he is a prosperous man,"
2039,42," thriving in trade and luke to him shall go,"
2040,42, and with his kinsman's help and his own thrift
2041,42," he quickly will repair this loss, and then"
2042,42," he may return to us. if here he stay,"
2043,42," what can be done? where every one is poor,"
2044,42," what can be gained?""       at this the old man paused,"
2045,42," and isabel sat silent, for her mind"
2046,42," was busy, looking back into past times."
2047,42," there's richard bateman, thought she to herself,"
2048,42, he was a parish-boy at the church-door
2049,42," they made a gathering for him, shillings, pence,"
2050,42," and halfpennies, wherewith the neighbours bought"
2051,42," a basket, which they filled with pedlar's wares;"
2052,42," and, with this basket on his arm, the lad"
2053,42," went up to london, found a master there,"
2054,42," who, out of many, chose the trusty boy"
2055,42, to go and overlook his merchandise
2056,42," beyond the seas; where he grew wondrous rich,"
2057,42," and left estates and monies to the poor,"
2058,42," and, at his birth-place, built a chapel floored"
2059,42," with marble, which he sent from foreign lands."
2060,42," these thoughts, and many others of like sort,"
2061,42," passed quickly through the mind of isabel,"
2062,42," and her face brightened. the old man was glad,"
2063,42," and thus resumed, ""well, isabel! this scheme"
2064,42, these two days has been meat and drink to me.
2065,42, far more than we have lost is left us yet.
2066,42,  we have enough i wish indeed that i
2067,42, were younger; but this hope is a good hope.
2068,42," make ready luke's best garments, of the best"
2069,42," buy for him more, and let us send him forth"
2070,42," to-morrow, or the next day, or to-night,"
2071,42,"  if he  could go, the boy should go to-night."""
2072,42,"    here michael ceased, and to the fields went forth"
2073,42, with a light heart. the housewife for five days
2074,42," was restless morn and night, and all day long"
2075,42, wrought on with her best fingers to prepare.
2076,42, things needful for the journey of her son.
2077,42, but isabel was glad when sunday came
2078,42," to stop her in her work, for, when she lay"
2079,42," by michael's side, she through the last two nights"
2080,42," heard him, how he was troubled in his sleep,"
2081,42, and when they rose at morning she could see
2082,42, that all his hopes were gone. that day at noon
2083,42," she said to luke, while they two by themselves"
2084,42," were sitting at the door, ""thou must not go,"
2085,42," we have no other child but thee to lose,"
2086,42," none to remember do not go away,"
2087,42," for if thou leave thy father he will die."""
2088,42, the youth made answer with a jocund voice;
2089,42," and isabel, when she had told her fears,"
2090,42, recovered heart. that evening her best fare
2091,42," did she bring forth, and all together sat"
2092,42, like happy people round a christmas fire.
2093,42,    with daylight isabel resumed her work;
2094,42, and all the ensuing week the house appeared
2095,42," as cheerful as a grove in spring, at length"
2096,42," the expected letter from their kinsman came,"
2097,42, with kind assurances that he would do
2098,42, his utmost for the welfare of the boy;
2099,42," to which requests were added, that forthwith"
2100,42, he might be sent to him. ten times or more
2101,42," the letter was read over, isabel"
2102,42, went forth to show it to the neighbours round;
2103,42, nor was there at that time on english land
2104,42, a prouder heart than luke's. when isabel
2105,42," had to her house returned, the old man said,"
2106,42," ""he shall depart to-morrow."" to this word"
2107,42," the housewife answered, talking much of things"
2108,42," which, if at such short notice he should go,"
2109,42, would surely be forgotten. but at length
2110,42," she gave consent, and michael was at ease."
2111,42,"    near the tumultuous brook of green-head ghyll,"
2112,42," in that deep valley, michael had designed"
2113,42," to build a sheep-fold; and, before he heard"
2114,42," the tidings of his melancholy loss,"
2115,42, for this same purpose he had gathered up
2116,42," a heap of stones, which by the streamlet's edge"
2117,42," lay thrown together, ready for the work."
2118,42," with luke that evening thitherward he walked,"
2119,42," and soon as they had reached the place he stopped,"
2120,42," and thus the old man spake to him, ""my son,"
2121,42," to-morrow thou wilt leave me, with full heart"
2122,42," i look upon thee, for thou art the same"
2123,42," that wert a promise to me ere thy birth,"
2124,42, and all thy life hast been my daily joy.
2125,42, i will relate to thee some little part
2126,42, of our two histories; 'twill do thee good
2127,42," when thou art from me, even if i should touch"
2128,42, on things thou canst not know of. after thou
2129,42, first cam'st into the world as oft befalls
2130,42, to new-born infants thou didst sleep away
2131,42," two days, and blessings from thy father's tongue"
2132,42," then fell upon thee. day by day passed on,"
2133,42, and still i loved thee with increasing love.
2134,42, never to living ear came sweeter sounds
2135,42, than when i heard thee by our own fireside
2136,42," first uttering, without words, a natural tune;"
2137,42," while thou, a feeding babe, didst in thy joy"
2138,42," sing at thy mother's breast. month followed month,"
2139,42," and in the open fields my life was passed,"
2140,42, and on the mountains; else i think that thou
2141,42, hadst been brought up upon thy father's knees.
2142,42," but we were playmates, luke, among these hills,"
2143,42," as well thou knowest, in us the old and young"
2144,42," have played together, nor with me didst thou"
2145,42," lack any pleasure which a boy can know."""
2146,42, luke had a manly heart; but at these words
2147,42," he sobbed aloud. the old man grasped his hand,"
2148,42," and said, ""nay, do not take it so i see"
2149,42, that these are things of which i need not speak.
2150,42,  even to the utmost i have been to thee
2151,42," a kind and a good father, and herein"
2152,42, i but repay a gift which i myself
2153,42," received at others' hands; for, though now old"
2154,42," beyond the common life of man, i still"
2155,42, remember them who loved me in my youth.
2156,42," both of them sleep together, here they lived,"
2157,42," as all their forefathers had done; and, when"
2158,42," at length their time was come, they were not loth"
2159,42, to give their bodies to the family mould.
2160,42," i wished that thou should'st live the life they lived,"
2161,42," but, 'tis a long time to look back, my son,"
2162,42, and see so little gain from threescore years.
2163,42, these fields were burthened when they came to me;
2164,42," till i was forty years of age, not more"
2165,42, than half of my inheritance was mine.
2166,42," i toiled and toiled; god blessed me in my work,"
2167,42, and till these three weeks past the land was free.
2168,42,  it looks as if it never could endure
2169,42," another master. heaven forgive me, luke,"
2170,42," if i judge ill for thee, but it seems good"
2171,42," that thou should'st go.""       at this the old man paused;"
2172,42," then, pointing to the stones near which they stood,"
2173,42," thus, after a short silence, he resumed,"
2174,42," ""this was a work for us; and now, my son,"
2175,42," it is a work for me. but, lay one stone "
2176,42," here, lay it for me, luke, with thine own hands."
2177,42," nay, boy, be of good hope; we both may live"
2178,42, to see a better day. at eighty-four
2179,42, i still am strong and hale; do thou thy part;
2180,42, i will do mine. i will begin again
2181,42," with many tasks that were resigned to thee,"
2182,42," up to the heights, and in among the storms,"
2183,42," will i without thee go again, and do"
2184,42," all works which i was wont to do alone,"
2185,42," before i knew thy face. heaven bless thee, boy!"
2186,42, thy heart these two weeks has been beating fast
2187,42, with many hopes; it should be so yes yes 
2188,42, i knew that thou could'st never have a wish
2189,42," to leave me, luke, thou hast been bound to me"
2190,42," only by links of love, when thou art gone,"
2191,42," what will be left to us! but, i forget"
2192,42," my purposes. lay now the corner-stone,"
2193,42," as i requested; and hereafter, luke,"
2194,42," when thou art gone away, should evil men"
2195,42," be thy companions, think of me, my son,"
2196,42," and of this moment; hither turn thy thoughts,"
2197,42," and god will strengthen thee, amid all fear"
2198,42," and all temptation, luke, i pray that thou"
2199,42," may'st bear in mind the life thy fathers lived,"
2200,42," who, being innocent, did for that cause"
2201,42," bestir them in good deeds. now, fare thee well "
2202,42," when thou return'st, thou in this place wilt see"
2203,42," a work which is not here, a covenant"
2204,42," 'twill be between us; but, whatever fate"
2205,42," befall thee, i shall love thee to the last,"
2206,42," and bear thy memory with me to the grave."""
2207,42,"    the shepherd ended here; and luke stooped down,"
2208,42," and, as his father had requested, laid"
2209,42, the first stone of the sheep-fold. at the sight
2210,42, the old man's grief broke from him; to his heart
2211,42," he pressed his son, he kissed him and wept;"
2212,42, and to the house together they returned.
2213,42,"  hushed was that house in peace, or seeming peace,"
2214,42," ere the night fell, with morrow's dawn the boy"
2215,42," began his journey, and, when he had reached"
2216,42," the public way, he put on a bold face;"
2217,42," and all the neighbours, as he passed their doors,"
2218,42," came forth with wishes and with farewell prayers,"
2219,42, that followed him till he was out of sight.
2220,42," a good report did from their kinsman come,"
2221,42, of luke and his well-doing; and the boy
2222,42," wrote loving letters, full of wondrous news,"
2223,42," which, as the housewife phrased it, were throughout"
2224,42," ""the prettiest letters that were ever seen."""
2225,42, both parents read them with rejoicing hearts.
2226,42," so, many months passed on, and once again"
2227,42, the shepherd went about his daily work
2228,42, with confident and cheerful thoughts; and now
2229,42, sometimes when he could find a leisure hour
2230,42," he to that valley took his way, and there"
2231,42, wrought at the sheep-fold. meantime luke began
2232,42," to slacken in his duty; and, at length,"
2233,42, he in the dissolute city gave himself
2234,42," to evil courses, ignominy and shame"
2235,42," fell on him, so that he was driven at last"
2236,42, to seek a hiding-place beyond the seas.
2237,42,    there is a comfort in the strength of love;
2238,42," 'twill make a thing endurable, which else"
2239,42," would overset the brain, or break the heart,"
2240,42, i have conversed with more than one who well
2241,42," remember the old man, and what he was"
2242,42, years after he had heard this heavy news.
2243,42, his bodily frame had been from youth to age
2244,42, of an unusual strength. among the rocks
2245,42," he went, and still looked up to sun and cloud,"
2246,42," and listened to the wind; and, as before,"
2247,42," performed all kinds of labour for his sheep,"
2248,42," and for the land, his small inheritance."
2249,42, and to that hollow dell from time to time
2250,42," did he repair, to build the fold of which"
2251,42, his flock had need. 'tis not forgotten yet
2252,42, the pity which was then in every heart
2253,42, for the old man and 'tis believed by all
2254,42," that many and many a day he thither went,"
2255,42, and never lifted up a single stone.
2256,42,"    there, by the sheep-fold, sometimes was he seen"
2257,42," sitting alone, or with his faithful dog,"
2258,42," then old, beside him, lying at his feet."
2259,42," the length of full seven years, from time to time,"
2260,42," he at the building of this sheep-fold wrought,"
2261,42, and left the work unfinished when he died.
2262,42," three years, or little more, did isabel"
2263,42," survive her husband, at her death the estate"
2264,42," was sold, and went into a stranger's hand."
2265,42, the cottage which was named the evening star
2266,42, is gone the ploughshare has been through the ground
2267,42, on which it stood; great changes have been wrought
2268,42," in all the neighbourhood, yet the oak is left"
2269,42, that grew beside their door; and the remains
2270,42, of the unfinished sheep-fold may be seen
2271,42, beside the boisterous brook of green-head ghyll.
2272,43,.  most sweet it is with unuplifted eyes
2273,43,"   to pace the ground, if path be there or none,"
2274,43,   while a fair region round the traveller lies
2275,43,   which he forbears again to look upon;
2276,43,"   pleased rather with some soft ideal scene,"
2277,43,"   the work of fancy, or some happy tone"
2278,43,"   of meditation, slipping in between"
2279,43,   the beauty coming and the beauty gone.
2280,43,"   if thought and love desert us, from that day"
2281,43,"  let us break off all commerce with the muse,"
2282,43,"  with thought and love companions of our way,"
2283,43,"  whate'er the senses take or may refuse,"
2284,43,  the mind's internal heaven shall shed her dews
2285,43,  of inspiration on the humblest lay.
2286,44,".    from low to high doth dissolution climb,"
2287,44,"   and sink from high to low, along a scale"
2288,44,"   of awful notes, whose concord shall not fail;"
2289,44,"   a musical but melancholy chime,"
2290,44,"   which they can hear who meddle not with crime,"
2291,44,"   nor avarice, nor over-anxious care."
2292,44,   truth fails not; but her outward forms that bear
2293,44,"   the longest date do melt like frosty rime,"
2294,44,   that in the morning whitened hill and plain
2295,44,  and is no more; drop like the tower sublime
2296,44,"  of yesterday, which royally did wear"
2297,44,"  his crown of weeds, but could not even sustain"
2298,44,"  some casual shout that broke the silent air,"
2299,44,  or the unimaginable touch of time.
2300,45,.   another year! another deadly blow!
2301,45,   another mighty empire overthrown!
2302,45,"   and we are left, or shall be left, alone;"
2303,45,   the last that dare to struggle with the foe.
2304,45,   'tis well! from this day forward we shall know
2305,45,   that in ourselves our safety must be sought;
2306,45,   that by our own right hands it must be wrought;
2307,45,"   that we must stand unpropped, or be laid low."
2308,45,   o dastard whom such foretaste doth not cheer!
2309,45,"  we shall exult, if they who rule the land"
2310,45,"  be men who hold its many blessings dear,"
2311,45,"  wise, upright, valiant; not a servile band,"
2312,45,"  who are to judge of danger which they fear,"
2313,45,  and honour which they do not understand.
2314,46,nuns fret not at their convent's narrow room;
2315,46,and hermits are contented with their cells;
2316,46,and students with their pensive citadels;
2317,46,"maids at the wheel, the weaver at his loom,"
2318,46,"sit blithe and happy; bees that soar for bloom,"
2319,46,"high as the highest peak of furness-fells,"
2320,46,"will murmur by the hour in foxglove bells,"
2321,46,"in truth the prison, unto which we doom"
2322,46,"ourselves, no prison is, and hence for me,"
2323,46,"in sundry moods, 'twas pastime to be bound"
2324,46,within the sonnet's scanty plot of ground;
2325,46,pleased if some souls for such there needs must be
2326,46,"who have felt the weight of too much liberty,"
2327,46,"should find brief solace there, as i have found."
2328,47,.          it seems a day
2329,47,   i speak of one from many singled out
2330,47,   one of those heavenly days that cannot die;
2331,47,"   when, in the eagerness of boyish hope,"
2332,47,"   i left our cottage-threshold, sallying forth"
2333,47,"   with a huge wallet o'er my shoulders slung,"
2334,47,   a nutting-crook in hand; and turned my steps
2335,47,"   tow'rd some far-distant wood, a figure quaint,"
2336,47,   tricked out in proud disguise of cast-off weeds
2337,47,"  which for that service had been husbanded,"
2338,47,  by exhortation of my frugal dame 
2339,47,"  motley accoutrement, of power to smile"
2340,47,"  at thorns, and brakes, and brambles, and, in truth,"
2341,47,"  more ragged than need was! o'er pathless rocks,"
2342,47,"  through beds of matted fern, and tangled thickets,"
2343,47,"  forcing my way, i came to one dear nook"
2344,47,"  unvisited, where not a broken bough"
2345,47,"  drooped with its withered leaves, ungracious sign"
2346,47,  of devastation; but the hazels rose
2347,47,"  tall and erect, with tempting clusters hung,"
2348,47,"  a virgin scene! a little while i stood,"
2349,47,  breathing with such suppression of the heart
2350,47,"  as joy delights in; and, with wise restraint"
2351,47,"  voluptuous, fearless of a rival, eyed"
2352,47,  the banquet; or beneath the trees i sate
2353,47,"  among the flowers, and with the flowers i played;"
2354,47,"  a temper known to those, who, after long"
2355,47,"  and weary expectation, have been blest"
2356,47,  with sudden happiness beyond all hope.
2357,47,  perhaps it was a bower beneath whose leaves
2358,47,  the violets of five seasons re-appear
2359,47,"  and fade, unseen by any human eye;"
2360,47,  where fairy water-breaks do murmur on
2361,47,"  for ever; and i saw the sparkling foam,"
2362,47,  and with my cheek on one of those green stones
2363,47,"  that, fleeced with moss, under the shady trees,"
2364,47,"  lay round me, scattered like a flock of sheep "
2365,47,"  i heard the murmur, and the murmuring sound,"
2366,47,  in that sweet mood when pleasure loves to pay
2367,47,"  tribute to ease; and, of its joy secure,"
2368,47,"  the heart luxuriates with indifferent things,"
2369,47,"  wasting its kindliness on stocks and stones,"
2370,47,"  and on the vacant air. then up i rose,"
2371,47,"  and dragged to earth both branch and bough, with crash"
2372,47,"  and merciless ravage, and the shady nook"
2373,47,"  of hazels, and the green and mossy bower,"
2374,47,"  deformed and sullied, patiently gave up"
2375,47,"  their quiet being, and, unless i now"
2376,47,  confound my present feelings with the past;
2377,47,  ere from the mutilated bower i turned
2378,47,"  exulting, rich beyond the wealth of kings,"
2379,47,  i felt a sense of pain when i beheld
2380,47,"  the silent trees, and saw the intruding sky. "
2381,47,"  then, dearest maiden, move along these shades"
2382,47,  in gentleness of heart; with gentle hand
2383,47,  touch for there is a spirit in the woods.
2384,48,o nightingale! thou surely art
2385,48,"a creature of a ""fiery heart"", "
2386,48,these notes of thine they pierce and pierce;
2387,48,tumultuous harmony and fierce!
2388,48,thou sing'st as if the god of wine
2389,48,had helped thee to a valentine;
2390,48,a song in mockery and despite
2391,48,"of shades, and dews, and silent night;"
2392,48,"and steady bliss, and all the loves"
2393,48,now sleeping in these peaceful groves.
2394,48,i heard a stock-dove sing or say
2395,48,"his homely tale, this very day;"
2396,48,"his voice was buried among trees,"
2397,48,"yet to be come at by the breeze,"
2398,48,he did not cease; but cooed and cooed;
2399,48,"and somewhat pensively he wooed,"
2400,48,"he sang of love, with quiet blending,"
2401,48,"slow to begin, and never ending;"
2402,48,"of serious faith, and inward glee;"
2403,48,that was the song   the song for me!
2404,49,".  these times strike monied worldlings with dismay,"
2405,49,"  even rich men, brave by nature, taint the air"
2406,49,"  with words of apprehension and despair,"
2407,49,"  while tens of thousands, thinking on the affray,"
2408,49,  men unto whom sufficient for the day
2409,49,"  and minds not stinted or untilled are given,"
2410,49,"  sound, healthy, children of the god of heaven,"
2411,49,  are cheerful as the rising sun in may.
2412,49,  what do we gather hence but firmer faith
2413,49, that every gift of noble origin
2414,49, is breathed upon by hope's perpetual breath;
2415,49, that virtue and the faculties within
2416,49," are vital, and that riches are akin"
2417,49," to fear, to change, to cowardice, and death?"

2447,50,    where the slim wild deer roves;
2448,50,and served in depths where fishes haunt
2449,50,    their own mysterious groves.

2457,50,    to open a bright eye.

2465,50,    or love within the breast.

3103,57,  even such a happy child of earth am i;
3104,57,  even as these blissful creatures do i fare;
3105,57,"  far from the world i walk, and from all care;"
3106,57,  but there may come another day to me 
3107,57,"  solitude, pain of heart, distress, and poverty."
3108,57,"  my whole life i have lived in pleasant thought,"
3109,57,  as if life's business were a summer mood;
3110,57,  as if all needful things would come unsought
3111,57,"  to genial faith, still rich in genial good;"
3112,57,  but how can he expect that others should
3113,57,"  build for him, sow for him, and at his call"
3114,57,"  love him, who for himself will take no heed at all?"
3115,57,"  i thought of chatterton, the marvellous boy,"
3116,57,  the sleepless soul that perished in his pride;
3117,57,  of him who walked in glory and in joy
3118,57,"  following his plough, along the mountain-side,"
3119,57,"  by our own spirits are we deified,"
3120,57,  we poets in our youth begin in gladness;
3121,57,  but thereof come in the end despondency and madness.
3122,57,"  now, whether it were by peculiar grace,"
3123,57,"  a leading from above, a something given,"
3124,57,"  yet it befell that, in this lonely place,"
3125,57,"  when i with these untoward thoughts had striven,"
3126,57,  beside a pool bare to the eye of heaven
3127,57,"  i saw a man before me unawares,"
3128,57,  the oldest man he seemed that ever wore grey hairs.
3129,57,  as a huge stone is sometimes seen to lie
3130,57,  couched on the bald top of an eminence;
3131,57,"  wonder to all who do the same espy,"
3132,57,"   by what means it could thither come, and whence;"
3133,57,"  so that it seems a thing endued with sense,"
3134,57,"  like a sea-beast crawled forth, that on a shelf"
3135,57,"  of rock or sand reposeth, there to sun itself;"
3136,57,"  such seemed this man, not all alive nor dead,"
3137,57,"  nor all asleep in his extreme old age,"
3138,57,"  his body was bent double, feet and head"
3139,57,  coming together in life's pilgrimage;
3140,57,"  as if some dire constraint of pain, or rage"
3141,57,"  of sickness felt by him in times long past,"
3142,57,  a more than human weight upon his frame had cast.
3143,57,"  himself he propped, limbs, body, and pale face,"
3144,57,"  upon a long grey staff of shaven wood,"
3145,57,"  and, still as i drew near with gentle pace,"
3146,57,  upon the margin of that moorish flood
3147,57,"  motionless as a cloud the old man stood,"
3148,57,"  that heareth not the loud winds when they call,"
3149,57,"  and moveth all together, if it move at all."
3150,57,"  at length, himself unsettling, he the pond"
3151,57,"  stirred with his staff, and fixedly did look"
3152,57,"  upon the muddy water, which he conned,"
3153,57,"  as if he had been reading in a book,"
3154,57,  and now a stranger's privilege i took;
3155,57,"  and, drawing to his side, to him did say,"
3156,57,"  ""this morning gives us promise of a glorious day."""
3157,57,"  a gentle answer did the old man make,"
3158,57,"  in courteous speech which forth he slowly drew,"
3159,57,"  and him with further words i thus bespake,"
3160,57,"  ""what occupation do you there pursue?"
3161,57,"  this is a lonesome place for one like you."""
3162,57,"  ere he replied, a flash of mild surprise"
3163,57,  broke from the sable orbs of his yet-vivid eyes.
3164,57,"  his words came feebly, from a feeble chest,"
3165,57,"  but each in solemn order followed each,"
3166,57,  with something of a lofty utterance drest 
3167,57,"  choice word and measured phrase, above the reach"
3168,57,  of ordinary men; a stately speech;
3169,57,"  such as grave livers do in scotland use,"
3170,57,"  religious men, who give to god and man their dues."
3171,57,"  he told, that to these waters he had come"
3172,57," to gather leeches, being old and poor,"
3173,57, employment hazardous and wearisome!
3174,57," and he had many hardships to endure,"
3175,57," from pond to pond he roamed, from moor to moor;"
3176,57," housing, with god's good help, by choice or chance;"
3177,57, and in this way he gained an honest maintenance.
3178,57, the old man still stood talking by my side;
3179,57, but now his voice to me was like a stream
3180,57, scarce heard; nor word from word could i divide;
3181,57, and the whole body of the man did seem
3182,57, like one whom i had met with in a dream;
3183,57," or like a man from some far region sent,"
3184,57," to give me human strength, by apt admonishment."
3185,57," my former thoughts returned, the fear that kills;"
3186,57, and hope that is unwilling to be fed;
3187,57," cold, pain, and labour, and all fleshly ills;"
3188,57, and mighty poets in their misery dead.
3189,57,"  perplexed, and longing to be comforted,"
3190,57," my question eagerly did i renew,"
3191,57," ""how is it that you live, and what is it you do?"""
3192,57, he with a smile did then his words repeat;
3193,57," and said that, gathering leeches, far and wide"
3194,57, he travelled; stirring thus about his feet
3195,57, the waters of the pools where they abide.
3196,57," ""once i could meet with them on every side;"
3197,57, but they have dwindled long by slow decay;
3198,57," yet still i persevere, and find them where i may."""
3199,57," while he was talking thus, the lonely place,"
3200,57," the old man's shape, and speech all troubled me,"
3201,57, in my mind's eye i seemed to see him pace
3202,57," about the weary moors continually,"
3203,57, wandering about alone and silently.
3204,57," while i these thoughts within myself pursued,"
3205,57," he, having made a pause, the same discourse renewed."
3206,57," and soon with this he other matter blended,"
3207,57," cheerfully uttered, with demeanour kind,"
3208,57," but stately in the main; and, when he ended,"
3209,57, i could have laughed myself to scorn to find
3210,57, in that decrepit man so firm a mind.
3211,57," ""god,"" said i, ""be my help and stay secure;"
3212,57," i'll think of the leech-gatherer on the lonely moor!"""
