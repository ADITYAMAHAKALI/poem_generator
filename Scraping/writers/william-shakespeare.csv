0,A Lover's Complaint,"FROM off a hill whose concave womb reworded
    A plaintful story from a sistering vale,
    My spirits to attend this double voice accorded,
    And down I laid to list the sad-tuned tale;
    Ere long espied a fickle maid full pale,
    Tearing of papers, breaking rings a-twain,
    Storming her world with sorrow's wind and rain.

    Upon her head a platted hive of straw,
    Which fortified her visage from the sun,
    Whereon the thought might think sometime it saw
    The carcass of beauty spent and done:
    Time had not scythed all that youth begun,
    Nor youth all quit; but, spite of heaven's fell rage,
    Some beauty peep'd through lattice of sear'd age.

    Oft did she heave her napkin to her eyne,
    Which on it had conceited characters,
    Laundering the silken figures in the brine
    That season'd woe had pelleted in tears,
    And often reading what contents it bears;
    As often shrieking undistinguish'd woe,
    In clamours of all size, both high and low.

    Sometimes her levell'd eyes their carriage ride,
    As they did battery to the spheres intend;
    Sometime diverted their poor balls are tied
    To the orbed earth; sometimes they do extend
    Their view right on; anon their gazes lend
    To every place at once, and, nowhere fix'd,
    The mind and sight distractedly commix'd.

    Her hair, nor loose nor tied in formal plat,
    Proclaim'd in her a careless hand of pride
    For some, untuck'd, descended her sheaved hat,
    Hanging her pale and pined cheek beside;
    Some in her threaden fillet still did bide,
    And true to bondage would not break from thence,
    Though slackly braided in loose negligence.

    A thousand favours from a maund she drew
    Of amber, crystal, and of beaded jet,
    Which one by one she in a river threw,
    Upon whose weeping margent she was set;
    Like usury, applying wet to wet,
    Or monarch's hands that let not bounty fall
    Where want cries some, but where excess begs all.

    Of folded schedules had she many a one,
    Which she perused, sigh'd, tore, and gave the flood;
    Crack'd many a ring of posied gold and bone
    Bidding them find their sepulchres in mud;
    Found yet moe letters sadly penn'd in blood,
    With sleided silk feat and affectedly
    Enswathed, and seal'd to curious secrecy.

    These often bathed she in her fluxive eyes,
    And often kiss'd, and often 'gan to tear:
    Cried 'O false blood, thou register of lies,
    What unapproved witness dost thou bear!
    Ink would have seem'd more black and damned here!'
    This said, in top of rage the lines she rents,
    Big discontent so breaking their contents.

    A reverend man that grazed his cattle nigh--
    Sometime a blusterer, that the ruffle knew
    Of court, of city, and had let go by
    The swiftest hours, observed as they flew--
    Towards this afflicted fancy fastly drew,
    And, privileged by age, desires to know
    In brief the grounds and motives of her woe.

    So slides he down upon his grained bat,
    And comely-distant sits he by her side;
    When he again desires her, being sat,
    Her grievance with his hearing to divide:
    If that from him there may be aught applied
    Which may her suffering ecstasy assuage,
    'Tis promised in the charity of age.

    'Father,' she says, 'though in me you behold
    The injury of many a blasting hour,
    Let it not tell your judgment I am old;
    Not age, but sorrow, over me hath power:
    I might as yet have been a spreading flower,
    Fresh to myself, If I had self-applied
    Love to myself and to no love beside.

    'But, woe is me! too early I attended
    A youthful suit--it was to gain my grace--
    Of one by nature's outwards so commended,
    That maidens' eyes stuck over all his face:
    Love lack'd a dwelling, and made him her place;
    And when in his fair parts she did abide,
    She was new lodged and newly deified.

    'His browny locks did hang in crooked curls;
    And every light occasion of the wind
    Upon his lips their silken parcels hurls.
    What's sweet to do, to do will aptly find:
    Each eye that saw him did enchant the mind,
    For on his visage was in little drawn
    What largeness thinks in Paradise was sawn.

    'Small show of man was yet upon his chin;
    His phoenix down began but to appear
    Like unshorn velvet on that termless skin
    Whose bare out-bragg'd the web it seem'd to wear:
    Yet show'd his visage by that cost more dear;
    And nice affections wavering stood in doubt
    If best were as it was, or best without.

    'His qualities were beauteous as his form,
    For maiden-tongued he was, and thereof free;
    Yet, if men moved him, was he such a storm
    As oft 'twixt May and April is to see,
    When winds breathe sweet, untidy though they be.
    His rudeness so with his authorized youth
    Did livery falseness in a pride of truth.

    'Well could he ride, and often men would say
    'That horse his mettle from his rider takes:
    Proud of subjection, noble by the sway,
    What rounds, what bounds, what course, what stop
    he makes!'
    And controversy hence a question takes,
    Whether the horse by him became his deed,
    Or he his manage by the well-doing steed.

    'But quickly on this side the verdict went:
    His real habitude gave life and grace
    To appertainings and to ornament,
    Accomplish'd in himself, not in his case:
    All aids, themselves made fairer by their place,
    Came for additions; yet their purposed trim
    Pieced not his grace, but were all graced by him.

    'So on the tip of his subduing tongue
    All kinds of arguments and question deep,
    All replication prompt, and reason strong,
    For his advantage still did wake and sleep:
    To make the weeper laugh, the laugher weep,
    He had the dialect and different skill,
    Catching all passions in his craft of will:

    'That he did in the general bosom reign
    Of young, of old; and sexes both enchanted,
    To dwell with him in thoughts, or to remain
    In personal duty, following where he haunted:
    Consents bewitch'd, ere he desire, have granted;
    And dialogued for him what he would say,
    Ask'd their own wills, and made their wills obey.

    'Many there were that did his picture get,
    To serve their eyes, and in it put their mind;
    Like fools that in th' imagination set
    The goodly objects which abroad they find
    Of lands and mansions, theirs in thought assign'd;
    And labouring in moe pleasures to bestow them
    Than the true gouty landlord which doth owe them:

    'So many have, that never touch'd his hand,
    Sweetly supposed them mistress of his heart.
    My woeful self, that did in freedom stand,
    And was my own fee-simple, not in part,
    What with his art in youth, and youth in art,
    Threw my affections in his charmed power,
    Reserved the stalk and gave him all my flower.

    'Yet did I not, as some my equals did,
    Demand of him, nor being desired yielded;
    Finding myself in honour so forbid,
    With safest distance I mine honour shielded:
    Experience for me many bulwarks builded
    Of proofs new-bleeding, which remain'd the foil
    Of this false jewel, and his amorous spoil.

    'But, ah, who ever shunn'd by precedent
    The destined ill she must herself assay?
    Or forced examples, 'gainst her own content,
    To put the by-past perils in her way?
    Counsel may stop awhile what will not stay;
    For when we rage, advice is often seen
    By blunting us to make our wits more keen.

    'Nor gives it satisfaction to our blood,
    That we must curb it upon others' proof;
    To be forbod the sweets that seem so good,
    For fear of harms that preach in our behoof.
    O appetite, from judgment stand aloof!
    The one a palate hath that needs will taste,
    Though Reason weep, and cry, 'It is thy last.'

    'For further I could say 'This man's untrue,'
    And knew the patterns of his foul beguiling;
    Heard where his plants in others' orchards grew,
    Saw how deceits were gilded in his smiling;
    Knew vows were ever brokers to defiling;
    Thought characters and words merely but art,
    And bastards of his foul adulterate heart.

    'And long upon these terms I held my city,
    Till thus he gan besiege me: 'Gentle maid,
    Have of my suffering youth some feeling pity,
    And be not of my holy vows afraid:
    That's to ye sworn to none was ever said;
    For feasts of love I have been call'd unto,
    Till now did ne'er invite, nor never woo.

    ''All my offences that abroad you see
    Are errors of the blood, none of the mind;
    Love made them not: with acture they may be,
    Where neither party is nor true nor kind:
    They sought their shame that so their shame did find;
    And so much less of shame in me remains,
    By how much of me their reproach contains.

    ''Among the many that mine eyes have seen,
    Not one whose flame my heart so much as warm'd,
    Or my affection put to the smallest teen,
    Or any of my leisures ever charm'd:
    Harm have I done to them, but ne'er was harm'd;
    Kept hearts in liveries, but mine own was free,
    And reign'd, commanding in his monarchy.

    ''Look here, what tributes wounded fancies sent me,
    Of paled pearls and rubies red as blood;
    Figuring that they their passions likewise lent me
    Of grief and blushes, aptly understood
    In bloodless white and the encrimson'd mood;
    Effects of terror and dear modesty,
    Encamp'd in hearts, but fighting outwardly.

    ''And, lo, behold these talents of their hair,
    With twisted metal amorously impleach'd,
    I have received from many a several fair,
    Their kind acceptance weepingly beseech'd,
    With the annexions of fair gems enrich'd,
    And deep-brain'd sonnets that did amplify
    Each stone's dear nature, worth, and quality.

    ''The diamond,--why, 'twas beautiful and hard,
    Whereto his invised properties did tend;
    The deep-green emerald, in whose fresh regard
    Weak sights their sickly radiance do amend;
    The heaven-hued sapphire and the opal blend
    With objects manifold: each several stone,
    With wit well blazon'd, smiled or made some moan.

    ''Lo, all these trophies of affections hot,
    Of pensived and subdued desires the tender,
    Nature hath charged me that I hoard them not,
    But yield them up where I myself must render,
    That is, to you, my origin and ender;
    For these, of force, must your oblations be,
    Since I their altar, you enpatron me.

    ''O, then, advance of yours that phraseless hand,
    Whose white weighs down the airy scale of praise;
    Take all these similes to your own command,
    Hallow'd with sighs that burning lungs did raise;
    What me your minister, for you obeys,
    Works under you; and to your audit comes
    Their distract parcels in combined sums.

    ''Lo, this device was sent me from a nun,
    Or sister sanctified, of holiest note;
    Which late her noble suit in court did shun,
    Whose rarest havings made the blossoms dote;
    For she was sought by spirits of richest coat,
    But kept cold distance, and did thence remove,
    To spend her living in eternal love.

    ''But, O my sweet, what labour is't to leave
    The thing we have not, mastering what not strives,
    Playing the place which did no form receive,
    Playing patient sports in unconstrained gyves?
    She that her fame so to herself contrives,
    The scars of battle 'scapeth by the flight,
    And makes her absence valiant, not her might.

    ''O, pardon me, in that my boast is true:
    The accident which brought me to her eye
    Upon the moment did her force subdue,
    And now she would the caged cloister fly:
    Religious love put out Religion's eye:
    Not to be tempted, would she be immured,
    And now, to tempt, all liberty procured.

    ''How mighty then you are, O, hear me tell!
    The broken bosoms that to me belong
    Have emptied all their fountains in my well,
    And mine I pour your ocean all among:
    I strong o'er them, and you o'er me being strong,
    Must for your victory us all congest,
    As compound love to physic your cold breast.

    ''My parts had power to charm a sacred nun,
    Who, disciplined, ay, dieted in grace,
    Believed her eyes when they to assail begun,
    All vows and consecrations giving place:
    O most potential love! vow, bond, nor space,
    In thee hath neither sting, knot, nor confine,
    For thou art all, and all things else are thine.

    ''When thou impressest, what are precepts worth
    Of stale example? When thou wilt inflame,
    How coldly those impediments stand forth
    Of wealth, of filial fear, law, kindred, fame!
    Love's arms are peace, 'gainst rule, 'gainst sense,
    'gainst shame,
    And sweetens, in the suffering pangs it bears,
    The aloes of all forces, shocks, and fears.

    ''Now all these hearts that do on mine depend,
    Feeling it break, with bleeding groans they pine;
    And supplicant their sighs to you extend,
    To leave the battery that you make 'gainst mine,
    Lending soft audience to my sweet design,
    And credent soul to that strong-bonded oath
    That shall prefer and undertake my troth.'

    'This said, his watery eyes he did dismount,
    Whose sights till then were levell'd on my face;
    Each cheek a river running from a fount
    With brinish current downward flow'd apace:
    O, how the channel to the stream gave grace!
    Who glazed with crystal gate the glowing roses
    That flame through water which their hue encloses.

    'O father, what a hell of witchcraft lies
    In the small orb of one particular tear!
    But with the inundation of the eyes
    What rocky heart to water will not wear?
    What breast so cold that is not warmed here?
    O cleft effect! cold modesty, hot wrath,
    Both fire from hence and chill extincture hath.

    'For, lo, his passion, but an art of craft,
    Even there resolved my reason into tears;
    There my white stole of chastity I daff'd,
    Shook off my sober guards and civil fears;
    Appear to him, as he to me appears,
    All melting; though our drops this difference bore,
    His poison'd me, and mine did him restore.

    'In him a plenitude of subtle matter,
    Applied to cautels, all strange forms receives,
    Of burning blushes, or of weeping water,
    Or swooning paleness; and he takes and leaves,
    In either's aptness, as it best deceives,
    To blush at speeches rank to weep at woes,
    Or to turn white and swoon at tragic shows.

    'That not a heart which in his level came
    Could 'scape the hail of his all-hurting aim,
    Showing fair nature is both kind and tame;
    And, veil'd in them, did win whom he would maim:
    Against the thing he sought he would exclaim;
    When he most burn'd in heart-wish'd luxury,
    He preach'd pure maid, and praised cold chastity.

    'Thus merely with the garment of a Grace
    The naked and concealed fiend he cover'd;
    That th' unexperient gave the tempter place,
    Which like a cherubin above them hover'd.
    Who, young and simple, would not be so lover'd?
    Ay me! I fell; and yet do question make
    What I should do again for such a sake.

    'O, that infected moisture of his eye,
    O, that false fire which in his cheek so glow'd,
    O, that forced thunder from his heart did fly,
    O, that sad breath his spongy lungs bestow'd,
    O, all that borrow'd motion seeming owed,
    Would yet again betray the fore-betray'd,
    And new pervert a reconciled maid!'"
1,All the World's a Stage,"All the world's a stage,
And all the men and women merely players;
They have their exits and their entrances,
And one man in his time plays many parts,
His acts being seven ages. At first, the infant,
Mewling and puking in the nurse's arms.
Then the whining schoolboy, with his satchel
And shining morning face, creeping like snail
Unwillingly to school. And then the lover,
Sighing like furnace, with a woeful ballad
Made to his mistress' eyebrow. Then a soldier,
Full of strange oaths and bearded like the pard,
Jealous in honor, sudden and quick in quarrel,
Seeking the bubble reputation
Even in the cannon's mouth. And then the justice,
In fair round belly with good capon lined,
With eyes severe and beard of formal cut,
Full of wise saws and modern instances;
And so he plays his part. The sixth age shifts
Into the lean and slippered pantaloon,
With spectacles on nose and pouch on side;
His youthful hose, well saved, a world too wide
For his shrunk shank, and his big manly voice,
Turning again toward childish treble, pipes
And whistles in his sound. Last scene of all,
That ends this strange eventful history,
Is second childishness and mere oblivion,
Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything."
2,Aubade,"HARK! hark! the lark at heaven's gate sings,
   And Phoebus 'gins arise,
His steeds to water at those springs
   On chaliced flowers that lies;
And winking Mary-buds begin
   To ope their golden eyes:
With everything that pretty bin,
   My lady sweet, arise!
   Arise, arise!"
3,"Blow, Blow, Thou Winter Wind","Blow, blow, thou winter wind
Thou art not so unkind
As man's ingratitude;
Thy tooth is not so keen,
Because thou art not seen,
Although thy breath be rude.

Heigh-ho! sing, heigh-ho! unto the green holly:
Most freindship if feigning, most loving mere folly:
Then heigh-ho, the holly!
This life is most jolly.

Freeze, freeze thou bitter sky,
That does not bite so nigh
As benefits forgot:
Though thou the waters warp,
Thy sting is not so sharp
As a friend remembered not.
Heigh-ho! sing, heigh-ho! unto the green holly:
Most freindship if feigning, most loving mere folly:
Then heigh-ho, the holly!
This life is most jolly."
4,Bridal Song,"ROSES, their sharp spines being gone,
Not royal in their smells alone,
   But in their hue;
Maiden pinks, of odour faint,
Daisies smell-less, yet most quaint,
   And sweet thyme true;

Primrose, firstborn child of Ver;
Merry springtime's harbinger,
   With her bells dim;
Oxlips in their cradles growing,
Marigolds on death-beds blowing,
   Larks'-heels trim;

All dear Nature's children sweet
Lie 'fore bride and bridegroom's feet,
   Blessing their sense!
Not an angel of the air,
Bird melodious or bird fair,
   Be absent hence!

The crow, the slanderous cuckoo, nor
The boding raven, nor chough hoar,
   Nor chattering pye,
May on our bride-house perch or sing,
Or with them any discord bring,
   But from it fly!"
5,Carpe Diem,"O mistress mine, where are you roaming?
O stay and hear! your true-love's coming
That can sing both high and low;
Trip no further, pretty sweeting,
Journey's end in lovers' meeting--
Every wise man's son doth know.

What is love? 'tis not hereafter;
Present mirth hath present laughter;
What's to come is still unsure:
In delay there lies no plenty,--
Then come kiss me, Sweet and twenty,
Youth's a stuff will not endure."
6,Dirge,"COME away, come away, death,
   And in sad cypres let me be laid;
Fly away, fly away, breath;
   I am slain by a fair cruel maid.
My shroud of white, stuck all with yew,
   O prepare it!
My part of death, no one so true
   Did share it.

Not a flower, not a flower sweet,
   On my black coffin let there be strown;
Not a friend, not a friend greet
   My poor corse, where my bones shall be thrown:
A thousand thousand sighs to save,
   Lay me, O, where
Sad true lover never find my grave
   To weep there!"
7,Dirge of the Three Queens,"URNS and odours bring away!
   Vapours, sighs, darken the day!
Our dole more deadly looks than dying;
   Balms and gums and heavy cheers,
   Sacred vials fill'd with tears,
And clamours through the wild air flying!

   Come, all sad and solemn shows,
   That are quick-eyed Pleasure's foes!
   We convent naught else but woes."
8,Fairy Land I,"OVER hill, over dale,
   Thorough bush, thorough brier,
   Over park, over pale,
   Thorough flood, thorough fire,
   I do wander everywhere,
   Swifter than the moone's sphere;
   And I serve the fairy queen,
   To dew her orbs upon the green:
   The cowslips tall her pensioners be;
   In their gold coats spots you see;
   Those be rubies, fairy favours,
   In those freckles live their savours:
   I must go seek some dew-drops here,
And hang a pearl in every cowslip's ear."
9,Fairy Land II,"YOU spotted snakes with double tongue,
   Thorny hedgehogs, be not seen;
Newts and blind-worms, do no wrong;
   Come not near our fairy queen.

   Philomel, with melody,
   Sing in our sweet lullaby;
   Lulla, lulla, lullaby; lulla, lulla, lullaby!
   Never harm,
   Nor spell nor charm,
   Come our lovely lady nigh;
   So, good night, with lullaby.

Weaving spiders, come not here;
   Hence, you long-legg'd spinners, hence!
Beetles black, approach not near;
   Worm nor snail, do no offence.

   Philomel, with melody,
   Sing in our sweet lullaby;
   Lulla, lulla, lullaby; lulla, lulla, lullaby!
   Never harm,
   Nor spell nor charm,
   Come our lovely lady nigh;
   So, good night, with lullaby."
10,Fairy Land III,"COME unto these yellow sands,
   And then take hands:
Court'sied when you have, and kiss'd,--
   The wild waves whist,--
Foot it featly here and there;
And, sweet sprites, the burthen bear.
   Hark, hark!
   Bow, wow,
   The watch-dogs bark:
   Bow, wow.
   Hark, hark! I hear
   The strain of strutting chanticleer
   Cry, Cock-a-diddle-dow!"
11,Fairy Land IV,"WHERE the bee sucks, there suck I:
In a cowslip's bell I lie;
There I couch when owls do cry.
On the bat's back I do fly
After summer merrily:
   Merrily, merrily, shall I live now,
   Under the blossom that hangs on the bough."
12,Fairy Land v,"FULL fathom five thy father lies;
Of his bones are coral made;
Those are pearls that were his eyes:
   Nothing of him that doth fade,
But doth suffer a sea-change
Into something rich and strange.
Sea-nymphs hourly ring his knell:
   Ding-dong.
   Hark! now I hear them--
   Ding-dong, bell!"
13,Fidele,"FEAR no more the heat o' the sun,
   Nor the furious winter's rages;
Thou thy worldly task hast done,
   Home art gone, and ta'en thy wages:
Golden lads and girls all must,
As chimney-sweepers, come to dust.

Fear no more the frown o' the great,
   Thou art past the tyrant's stroke;
Care no more to clothe and eat;
   To thee the reed is as the oak:
The sceptre, learning, physic, must
All follow this, and come to dust.

Fear no more the lightning-flash,
   Nor the all-dreaded thunder-stone;
Fear not slander, censure rash;
   Thou hast finish'd joy and moan:
All lovers young, all lovers must
Consign to thee, and come to dust.

No exorciser harm thee!
Nor no witchcraft charm thee!
Ghost unlaid forbear thee!
Nothing ill come near thee!
Quiet consummation have;
And renowned be thy grave!"
14,from Venus and Adonis,"But, lo! from forth a copse that neighbours by,
A breeding jennet, lusty, young, and proud,
Adonis' trampling courser doth espy,
And forth she rushes, snorts and neighs aloud;
The strong-neck'd steed, being tied unto a tree,
Breaketh his rein, and to her straight goes he.

Imperiously he leaps, he neighs, he bounds,
And now his woven girths he breaks asunder;
The bearing earth with his hard hoof he wounds,
Whose hollow womb resounds like heaven's thunder;
The iron bit he crushes 'tween his teeth
Controlling what he was controlled with.

His ears up-prick'd; his braided hanging mane
Upon his compass'd crest now stand on end;
His nostrils drink the air, and forth again,
As from a furnace, vapours doth he send:
His eye, which scornfully glisters like fire,
Shows his hot courage and his high desire.

Sometime her trots, as if he told the steps,
With gentle majesty and modest pride;
Anon he rears upright, curvets and leaps,
As who should say, 'Lo! thus my strength is tried;
And this I do to captivate the eye
Of the fair breeder that is standing by.'

What recketh he his rider's angry stir,
His flattering 'Holla,' or his 'Stand, I say?'
What cares he now for curb of pricking spur?
For rich caparisons or trapping gay?
He sees his love, and nothing else he sees,
Nor nothing else with his proud sight agrees.

Look, when a painter would surpass the life,
In limning out a well-proportion'd steed,
His art with nature's workmanship at strife,
As if the dead the living should exceed;
So did this horse excel a common one,
In shape, in courage, colour, pace and bone

Round-hoof'd, short-jointed, fetlocks shag and long,
Broad breast, full eye, small head, and nostril wide,
High crest, short ears, straight legs and passing strong,
Thin mane, thick tail, broad buttock, tender hide:
Look, what a horse should have he did not lack,
Save a proud rider on so proud a back.

Sometimes he scuds far off, and there he stares;
Anon he starts at stirring of a feather;
To bid the wind a race he now prepares,
And whe'r he run or fly they know not whether;
For through his mane and tail the high wind sings,
Fanning the hairs, who wave like feather'd wings.

He looks upon his love, and neighs unto her;
She answers him as if she knew his mind;
Being proud, as females are, to see him woo her,
She puts on outward strangeness, seems unkind,
Spurns at his love and scorns the heat he feels,
Beating his kind embracements with her heels.

Then, like a melancholy malcontent,
He vails his tail that, like a falling plume
Cool shadow to his melting buttock lent:
He stamps, and bites the poor flies in his fume.
His love, perceiving how he is enrag'd,
Grew kinder, and his fury was assuag'd.

His testy master goeth about to take him;
When lo! the unback'd breeder, full of fear,
Jealous of catching, swiftly doth forsake him,
With her the horse, and left Adonis there.
As they were mad, unto the wood they hie them,
Out-stripping crows that strive to over-fly them.

I prophesy they death, my living sorrow,
If thou encounter with the boar to-morrow.

""But if thou needs wilt hunt, be rul'd by me;
Uncouple at the timorous flying hare,
Or at the fox which lives by subtlety,
Or at the roe which no encounter dare:
Pursue these fearful creatures o'er the downs,
And on they well-breath'd horse keep with they hounds.

""And when thou hast on food the purblind hare,
Mark the poor wretch, to overshoot his troubles
How he outruns with winds, and with what care
He cranks and crosses with a thousand doubles:
The many musits through the which he goes
Are like a labyrinth to amaze his foes.

""Sometime he runs among a flock of sheep,
To make the cunning hounds mistake their smell,
And sometime where earth-delving conies keep,
To stop the loud pursuers in their yell,
And sometime sorteth with a herd of deer;
Danger deviseth shifts; wit waits on fear:

""For there his smell with other being mingled,
The hot scent-snuffing hounds are driven to doubt,
Ceasing their clamorous cry till they have singled
With much ado the cold fault cleanly out;
Then do they spend their mouths: Echo replies,
As if another chase were in the skies.

""By this, poor Wat, far off upon a hill,
Stands on his hinder legs with listening ear,
To hearken if his foes pursue him still:
Anon their loud alarums he doth hear;
And now his grief may be compared well
To one sore sick that hears the passing-bell.

""Then shalt thou see the dew-bedabbled wretch
Turn, and return, indenting with the way;
Each envious briar his weary legs doth scratch,
Each shadow makes him stop, each murmur stay:
For misery is trodden on by many,
And being low never reliev'd by any.

""Lie quietly, and hear a little more;
Nay, do not struggle, for thou shalt not rise:
To make thee hate the hunting of the boar,
Unlike myself thou hear'st me moralize,
Applying this to that, and so to so;
For love can comment upon every woe."""
15,From you have I been absent in the spring... (Sonnet 98),"From you have I been absent in the spring,
When proud-pied April, dressed in all his trim,
Hath put a spirit of youth in everything,
That heavy Saturn laughed and leaped with him,
Yet nor the lays of birds, nor the sweet smell
Of different flowers in odor and in hue,
Could make me any summer's story tell,
Or from their proud lap pluck them where they grew.
Nor did I wonder at the lily's white,
Nor praise the deep vermilion in the rose;
They were but sweet, but figures of delight,
Drawn after you, you pattern of all those.
Yet seemed it winter still, and, you away,
As with your shadow I with these did play."
16,Orpheus with his Lute Made Trees,"Orpheus with his lute made trees,
    And the mountain tops that freeze,
      Bow themselves, when he did sing:
    To his music plants and flowers
    Ever sprung; as sun and showers
      There had made a lasting spring.

    Everything that heard him play,
    Even the billows of the sea,
      Hung their heads, and then lay by.
  In sweet music is such art,
  Killing care and grief of heart
    Fall asleep, or hearing, die."
17,Sigh No More,"Sigh no more, ladies, sigh no more,
Men were deceivers ever;
One foot in sea, and one on shore,
To one thing constant never.
Then sigh not so,
But let them go,
And be you blith and bonny,
Converting all your sounds of woe
Into Hey nonny, nonny.

Sing no more ditties, sing no mo
Of dumps so dull and heavy;
The fraud of men was ever so,
Since summer first was leavy.
Then sigh not so,
But let them go,
And be you blith and bonny,
Converting all your sounds of woe
Into Hey nonny, nonny."
18,Sonnet 106: When in the Chronicle of Wasted Time,"When in the chronicle of wasted time
  I see descriptions of the fairest wights,
  And beauty making beautiful old rhyme
  In praise of ladies dead and lovely knights,
  Then, in the blazon of sweet beauty's best,
  Of hand, of foot, of lip, of eye, of brow,
  I see their antique pen would have express'd
  Even such a beauty as you master now.
  So all their praises are but prophecies
  Of this our time, all you prefiguring;
  And, for they look'd but with divining eyes,
  They had not skill enough your worth to sing:
  For we, which now behold these present days,
  Have eyes to wonder, but lack tongues to praise."
19,Sonnet 8,"Music to hear, why hear'st thou music sadly?
Sweets with sweets war not, joy delights in joy.
Why lovest thou that which thou receivest not gladly,
Or else receivest with pleasure thine annoy?
If the true concord of well-tuned sounds,
By unions married, do offend thine ear,
They do but sweetly chide thee, who confounds
In singleness the parts that thou shouldst bear.
Mark how one string, sweet husband to another,
Strikes each in each by mutual ordering,
Resembling sire and child and happy mother
Who all in one, one pleasing note do sing:
Whose speechless song, being many, seeming one,
Sings this to thee: 'thou single wilt prove none.'"
20,"Sonnet CVII: Not Mine Own Fears, Nor the Prophetic Soul","Not mine own fears, nor the prophetic soul
Of the wide world dreaming on things to come,
Can yet the lease of my true love control,
Suppos'd as forfeit to a confin'd doom.
The mortal moon hath her eclipse endur'd
And the sad augurs mock their own presage;
Incertainties now crown themselves assur'd
And peace proclaims olives of endless age.
Now with the drops of this most balmy time
My love looks fresh, and Death to me subscribes,
Since, spite of him, I'll live in this poor rhyme,
While he insults o'er dull and speechless tribes;
And thou in this shalt find thy monument,
When tyrants' crests and tombs of brass are spent."
21,"Sonnet CXI: O, for my sake do you with Fortune chide","O, for my sake do you with Fortune chide,
The guilty goddess of my harmful deeds,
That did not better for my life provide
Than public means which public manners breeds.
Thence comes it that my name receives a brand,
And almost thence my nature is subdu'd
To what it works in, like the dyer's hand.
Pity me then and wish I were renew'd;
Whilst, like a willing patient, I will drink
Potions of eisel 'gainst my strong infection;
No bitterness that I will bitter think,
Nor double penance, to correct correction.
Pity me then, dear friend, and I assure ye
Even that your pity is enough to cure me."
22,Sonnet CXLV,"Those lips that Love's own hand did make
Breath'd forth the sound that said I hate
To me that languish'd for her sake:
But when she saw my woeful state,
Straight in her heart did mercy come.
Chiding that tongue, that ever sweet
Was used in giving gentle doom:
And taught it thus anew to greet:
'I hate' she alter'd with an end
That follow'd it as gentle day
Doth follow night, who like a fiend
From heaven to hell is flown away.
'I hate' from hate away she threw,
And sav'd my life, saying 'not you'"
23,Sonnet CXVI: Let me not to the marriage of true minds,"Let me not to the marriage of true minds
Admit impediments. Love is not love
Which alters when it alteration finds,
Or bends with the remover to remove:
O no! it is an ever-fixed mark
That looks on tempests and is never shaken;
It is the star to every wandering bark,
Whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken.
Love's not Time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks
Within his bending sickle's compass come:
Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks,
But bears it out even to the edge of doom.
If this be error and upon me proved,
I never writ, nor no man ever loved."
24,Sonnet CXXX: My mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun,"My mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun;
   Coral is far more red than her lips' red:
   If snow be white, why then her breasts are dun;
   If hairs be wires, black wires grow on her head.
   I have seen roses damask'd, red and white,
   But no such roses see I in her cheeks;
   And in some perfumes is there more delight
   Than in the breath that from my mistress reeks.
   I love to hear her speak, yet well I know
  That music hath a far more pleasing sound.
  I grant I never saw a goddess go:
  My mistress, when she walks, treads on the ground.
  And yet, by heaven, I think my love as rare
  As any she belied with false compare."
25,Sonnet I: From Fairest Creatures We Desire Increase,"From fairest creatures we desire increase,
That thereby beauty's rose might never die,
But as the riper should by time decease,
His tender heir might bear his memory:
But thou, contracted to thine own bright eyes,
Feed'st thy light'st flame with self-substantial fuel,
Making a famine where abundance lies,
Thyself thy foe, to thy sweet self too cruel.
Thou that art now the world's fresh ornament
And only herald to the gaudy spring,
Within thine own bud buriest thy content
And, tender churl, makest waste in niggarding.
Pity the world, or else this glutton be,
To eat the world's due, by the grave and thee."
26,Sonnet II: When Forty Winters Shall Besiege Thy Brow,"When forty winters shall besiege thy brow,
And dig deep trenches in thy beauty's field,
Thy youth's proud livery, so gazed on now,
Will be a tatter'd weed, of small worth held:
Then being ask'd where all thy beauty lies,
Where all the treasure of thy lusty days,
To say, within thine own deep-sunken eyes,
Were an all-eating shame and thriftless praise.
How much more praise deserved thy beauty's use,
If thou couldst answer 'This fair child of mine
Shall sum my count and make my old excuse,'
Proving his beauty by succession thine!
This were to be new made when thou art old,
And see thy blood warm when thou feel'st it cold."
27,"Sonnet III: Look In Thy Glass, and Tell the Face Thou Viewest","Look in thy glass, and tell the face thou viewest
Now is the time that face should form another;
Whose fresh repair if now thou not renewest,
Thou dost beguile the world, unbless some mother.
For where is she so fair whose unear'd womb
Disdains the tillage of thy husbandry?
Or who is he so fond will be the tomb
Of his self-love, to stop posterity?
Thou art thy mother's glass, and she in thee
Calls back the lovely April of her prime:
So thou through windows of thine age shall see
Despite of wrinkles this thy golden time.
But if thou live, remember'd not to be,
Die single, and thine image dies with thee."
28,"Sonnet IV: Unthrifty Loveliness, Why Dost Thou Spend","Unthrifty loveliness, why dost thou spend
Upon thy self thy beauty's legacy?
Nature's bequest gives nothing, but doth lend,
And being frank she lends to those are free:
Then, beauteous niggard, why dost thou abuse
The bounteous largess given thee to give?
Profitless usurer, why dost thou use
So great a sum of sums, yet canst not live?
For having traffic with thy self alone,
Thou of thy self thy sweet self dost deceive:
Then how when nature calls thee to be gone,
What acceptable audit canst thou leave?
Thy unused beauty must be tombed with thee,
Which, used, lives th' executor to be."
29,Sonnet LXIV: When I Have Seen by Time's Fell Hand Defac'd,"When I have seen by Time's fell hand defac'd
The rich proud cost of outworn buried age;
When sometime lofty towers I see down-ras'd
And brass eternal slave to mortal rage;
When I have seen the hungry ocean gain
Advantage on the kingdom of the shore,
And the firm soil win of the wat'ry main,
Increasing store with loss and loss with store;
When I have seen such interchange of state,
Or state itself confounded to decay;
Ruin hath taught me thus to ruminate,
That Time will come and take my love away.
This thought is as a death, which cannot choose
But weep to have that which it fears to lose."
30,"Sonnet V: Those Hours, That With Gentle Work Did Frame","Those hours, that with gentle work did frame
The lovely gaze where every eye doth dwell,
Will play the tyrants to the very same
And that unfair which fairly doth excel;
For never-resting time leads summer on
To hideous winter, and confounds him there;
Sap checked with frost, and lusty leaves quite gone,
Beauty o'er-snowed and bareness every where:
Then were not summer's distillation left,
A liquid prisoner pent in walls of glass,
Beauty's effect with beauty were bereft,
Nor it, nor no remembrance what it was:
But flowers distill'd, though they with winter meet,
Leese but their show; their substance still lives sweet."
31,Sonnet XCIV: They That Have Power to Hurt and Will Do None,"They that have power to hurt and will do none,
That do not do the thing they most do show,
Who, moving others, are themselves as stone,
Unmoved, cold, and to temptation slow:
They rightly do inherit heaven's graces
And husband nature's riches from expense;
They are the lords and owners of their faces,
Others but stewards of their excellence.
The summer's flower is to the summer sweet
Though to itself it only live and die,
But if that flower with base infection meet,
The basest weed outbraves his dignity:
For sweetest things turn sourest by their deeds;
Lilies that fester smell far worse than weeds."
32,Sonnet XV: When I consider everything that grows,"When I consider everything that grows
Holds in perfection but a little moment,
That this huge stage presenteth nought but shows
Whereon the stars in secret influence comment;
When I perceive that men as plants increase,
Cheered and check'd even by the selfsame sky,
Vaunt in their youthful sap, at height decrease,
And wear their brave state out of memory;
Then the conceit of this inconstant stay
Sets you most rich in youth before my sight,
Where wasteful Time debateth with Decay
To change your day of youth to sullied night;
And all in war with Time for love of you,
As he takes from you, I engraft you new."
