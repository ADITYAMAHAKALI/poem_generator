0,"'Tis Said, That Some Have Died For Love","'Tis said, that some have died for love:
And here and there a churchyard grave is found
In the cold north's unhallowed ground,
Because the wretched man himself had slain,
His love was such a grievous pain.
And there is one whom I five years have known;
He dwells alone
Upon Helvellyn's side:
He loved--the pretty Barbara died;
And thus he makes his moan:
Three years had Barbara in her grave been laid
When thus his moan he made:

""Oh, move, thou Cottage, from behind that oak!
Or let the aged tree uprooted lie,
That in some other way yon smoke
May mount into the sky!
The clouds pass on; they from the heavens depart.
I look--the sky is empty space;
I know not what I trace;
But when I cease to look, my hand is on my heart.

""Oh! what a weight is in these shades! Ye leaves,
That murmur once so dear, when will it cease?
Your sound my heart of rest bereaves,
It robs my heart of peace.
Thou Thrush, that singest loud--and loud and free,
Into yon row of willows flit,
Upon that alder sit;
Or sing another song, or choose another tree.

""Roll back, sweet Rill! back to thy mountain-bounds,
And there for ever be thy waters chained!
For thou dost haunt the air with sounds
That cannot be sustained;
If still beneath that pine-tree's ragged bough
Headlong yon waterfall must come,
Oh let it then be dumb!
Be anything, sweet Rill, but that which thou art now.

""Thou Eglantine, so bright with sunny showers,
Proud as a rainbow spanning half the vale,
Thou one fair shrub, oh! shed thy flowers,
And stir not in the gale.
For thus to see thee nodding in the air,
To see thy arch thus stretch and bend,
Thus rise and thus descend,--
Disturbs me till the sight is more than I can dear.""

The Man who makes this feverish complaint
Is one of giant stature, who could dance
Equipped from head to foot in iron mail.
Ah gentle Love! if ever thought was thine
To store up kindred hours for me, thy face
Turn from me, gentle Love! nor let me walk
Within the sound of Emma's voice, nor know
Such happiness as I have known to-day."
1,A Character,"I marvel how Nature could ever find space
For so many strange contrasts in one human face:
There's thought and no thought, and there's paleness and bloom
And bustle and sluggishness, pleasure and gloom.

There's weakness, and strength both redundant and vain;
Such strength as, if ever affliction and pain
Could pierce through a temper that's soft to disease,
Would be rational peace--a philosopher's ease.

There's indifference, alike when he fails or succeeds,
And attention full ten times as much as there needs;
Pride where there's no envy, there's so much of joy;
And mildness, and spirit both forward and coy.

There's freedom, and sometimes a diffident stare
Of shame scarcely seeming to know that she's there,
There's virtue, the title it surely may claim,
Yet wants heaven knows what to be worthy the name.

This picture from nature may seem to depart,
Yet the Man would at once run away with your heart;
And I for five centuries right gladly would be
Such an odd such a kind happy creature as he."
2,A Complaint,"There is a change--and I am poor;
Your love hath been, nor long ago,
A fountain at my fond heart's door,
Whose only business was to flow;
And flow it did; not taking heed
Of its own bounty, or my need.
What happy moments did I count!
Blest was I then all bliss above!
Now, for that consecrated fount
Of murmuring, sparkling, living love,
What have I? shall I dare to tell?
A comfortless and hidden well.

A well of love--it may be deep--
I trust it is,--and never dry:
What matter? if the waters sleep
In silence and obscurity.
--Such change, and at the very door
Of my fond heart, hath made me poor."
3,A Narrow Girdle of Rough Stones and Crags,"A narrow girdle of rough stones and crags,
A rude and natural causeway, interposed
Between the water and a winding slope
Of copse and thicket, leaves the eastern shore
Of Grasmere safe in its own privacy:
And there myself and two beloved Friends,
One calm September morning, ere the mist
Had altogether yielded to the sun,
Sauntered on this retired and difficult way.
----Ill suits the road with one in haste; but we
Played with our time; and, as we strolled along,
It was our occupation to observe
Such objects as the waves had tossed ashore--
Feather, or leaf, or weed, or withered bough,
Each on the other heaped, along the line
Of the dry wreck. And, in our vacant mood,
Not seldom did we stop to watch some tuft
Of dandelion seed or thistle's beard,
That skimmed the surface of the dead calm lake,
Suddenly halting now--a lifeless stand!
And starting off again with freak as sudden;
In all its sportive wanderings, all the while,
Making report of an invisible breeze
That was its wings, its chariot, and its horse,
Its playmate, rather say, its moving soul.
--And often, trifling with a privilege
Alike indulged to all, we paused, one now,
And now the other, to point out, perchance
To pluck, some flower or water-weed, too fair
Either to be divided from the place
On which it grew, or to be left alone
To its own beauty. Many such there are,
Fair ferns and flowers, and chiefly that tall fern,
So stately, of the queen Osmunda named;
Plant lovelier, in its own retired abode
On Grasmere's beach, than Naiad by the side
Of Grecian brook, or Lady of the Mere,
Sole-sitting by the shores of old romance.
--So fared we that bright morning: from the fields
Meanwhile, a noise was heard, the busy mirth
Of reapers, men and women, boys and girls.
Delighted much to listen to those sounds,
And feeding thus our fancies, we advanced
Along the indented shore; when suddenly,
Through a thin veil of glittering haze was seen
Before us, on a point of jutting land,
The tall and upright figure of a Man
Attired in peasant's garb, who stood alone,
Angling beside the margin of the lake.
""Improvident and reckless,"" we exclaimed,
""The Man must be, who thus can lose a day
Of the mid harvest, when the labourer's hire
Is ample, and some little might be stored
Wherewith to cheer him in the winter time.""
Thus talking of that Peasant, we approached
Close to the spot where with his rod and line
He stood alone; whereat he turned his head
To greet us--and we saw a Mam worn down
By sickness, gaunt and lean, with sunken cheeks
And wasted limbs, his legs so long and lean
That for my single self I looked at them,
Forgetful of the body they sustained.--
Too weak to labour in the harvest field,
The Man was using his best skill to gain
A pittance from the dead unfeeling lake
That knew not of his wants. I will not say
What thoughts immediately were ours, nor how
The happy idleness of that sweet morn,
With all its lovely images, was changed
To serious musing and to self-reproach.
Nor did we fail to see within ourselves
What need there is to be reserved in speech,
And temper all our thoughts with charity.
--Therefore, unwilling to forget that day,
My Friend, Myself, and She who then received
The same admonishment, have called the place
By a memorial name, uncouth indeed
As e'er by mariner was given to bay
Or foreland, on a new-discovered coast;
And POINT RASH-JUDGMENT is the name it bears."
4,A Night Thought,"Lo! where the Moon along the sky
Sails with her happy destiny;
Oft is she hid from mortal eye
Or dimly seen,
But when the clouds asunder fly
How bright her mien!

Far different we--a froward race,
Thousands though rich in Fortune's grace
With cherished sullenness of pace
Their way pursue,
Ingrates who wear a smileless face
The whole year through.

If kindred humours e'er would make
My spirit droop for drooping's sake,
From Fancy following in thy wake,
Bright ship of heaven!
A counter impulse let me take
And be forgiven."
5,A Night-Piece,"------The sky is overcast
With a continuous cloud of texture close,
Heavy and wan, all whitened by the Moon,
Which through that veil is indistinctly seen,
A dull, contracted circle, yielding light
So feebly spread, that not a shadow falls,
Chequering the ground--from rock, plant, tree, or tower.
At length a pleasant instantaneous gleam
Startles the pensive traveller while he treads
His lonesome path, with unobserving eye
Bent earthwards; he looks up--the clouds are split
Asunder,--and above his head he sees
The clear Moon, and the glory of the heavens.
There, in a black-blue vault she sails along,
Followed by multitudes of stars, that, small
And sharp, and bright, along the dark abyss
Drive as she drives: how fast they wheel away,
Yet vanish not!--the wind is in the tree,
But they are silent;--still they roll along
Immeasurably distant; and the vault,
Built round by those white clouds, enormous clouds,
Still deepens its unfathomable depth.
At length the Vision closes; and the mind,
Not undisturbed by the delight it feels,
Which slowly settles into peaceful calm,
Is left to muse upon the solemn scene."
6,A Poet! He Hath Put his Heart to School,".    A poet!--He hath put his heart to school,
   Nor dares to move unpropped upon the staff
   Which art hath lodged within his hand--must laugh
   By precept only, and shed tears by rule.
   Thy Art be Nature; the live current quaff,
   And let the groveller sip his stagnant pool,
   In fear that else, when Critics grave and cool
   Have killed him, Scorn should write his epitaph.
   How does the Meadow-flower its bloom unfold?
  Because the lovely little flower is free
  Down to its root, and, in that freedom, bold;
  And so the grandeur of the Forest-tree
  Comes not by casting in a formal mould,
  But from its own divine vitality."
7,A Poet's Epitaph,"Art thou a Statist in the van
Of public conflicts trained and bred?
--First learn to love one living man;
'Then' may'st thou think upon the dead.

A Lawyer art thou?--draw not nigh!
Go, carry to some fitter place
The keenness of that practised eye,
The hardness of that sallow face.

Art thou a Man of purple cheer?
A rosy Man, right plump to see?
Approach; yet, Doctor, not too near,
This grave no cushion is for thee.

Or art thou one of gallant pride,
A Soldier and no man of chaff?
Welcome!--but lay thy sword aside,
And lean upon a peasant's staff.

Physician art thou? one, all eyes,
Philosopher! a fingering slave,
One that would peep and botanise
Upon his mother's grave?

Wrapt closely in thy sensual fleece,
O turn aside,--and take, I pray,
That he below may rest in peace,
Thy ever-dwindling soul, away!

A Moralist perchance appears;
Led, Heaven knows how! to this poor sod:
And he has neither eyes nor ears;
Himself his world, and his own God;

One to whose smooth-rubbed soul can cling
Nor form, nor feeling, great or small;
A reasoning, self-sufficing thing,
An intellectual All-in-all!

Shut close the door; press down the latch;
Sleep in thy intellectual crust;
Nor lose ten tickings of thy watch
Near this unprofitable dust.

But who is He, with modest looks,
And clad in homely russet brown?
He murmurs near the running brooks
A music sweeter than their own.

He is retired as noontide dew,
Or fountain in a noon-day grove;
And you must love him, ere to you
He will seem worthy of your love.

The outward shows of sky and earth,
Of hill and valley, he has viewed;
And impulses of deeper birth
Have come to him in solitude.

In common things that round us lie
Some random truths he can impart,--
The harvest of a quiet eye
That broods and sleeps on his own heart.

But he is weak; both Man and Boy,
Hath been an idler in the land;
Contented if he might enjoy
The things which others understand.

--Come hither in thy hour of strength;
Come, weak as is a breaking wave!
Here stretch thy body at full length;
Or build thy house upon this grave."
8,A Whirl-Blast from Behind the Hill,"A Whirl-Blast from behind the hill
Rushed o'er the wood with startling sound;
Then--all at once the air was still,
And showers of hailstones pattered round.
Where leafless oaks towered high above,
I sat within an undergrove
Of tallest hollies, tall and green;
A fairer bower was never seen.
From year to year the spacious floor
With withered leaves is covered o'er,
And all the year the bower is green.
But see! where'er the hailstones drop
The withered leaves all skip and hop;
There's not a breeze--no breath of air--
Yet here, and there, and everywhere
Along the floor, beneath the shade
By those embowering hollies made,
The leaves in myriads jump and spring,
As if with pipes and music rare
Some Robin Good-fellow were there,
And all those leaves, in festive glee,
Were dancing to the minstrelsy."
9,A Wren's Nest,"AMONG the dwellings framed by birds
    In field or forest with nice care,
Is none that with the little Wren's
    In snugness may compare.

No door the tenement requires,
    And seldom needs a laboured roof;
Yet is it to the fiercest sun
    Impervious, and storm-proof.

So warm, so beautiful withal,
    In perfect fitness for its aim,
That to the Kind by special grace
    Their instinct surely came.

And when for their abodes they seek
    An opportune recess,
The hermit has no finer eye
    For shadowy quietness.

These find, 'mid ivied abbey-walls,
    A canopy in some still nook;
Others are pent-housed by a brae
    That overhangs a brook.

There to the brooding bird her mate
    Warbles by fits his low clear song;
And by the busy streamlet both
    Are sung to all day long.

Or in sequestered lanes they build,
    Where, till the flitting bird's return,
Her eggs within the nest repose,
    Like relics in an urn.

But still, where general choice is good,
    There is a better and a best;
And, among fairest objects, some
    Are fairer than the rest;

This, one of those small builders proved
    In a green covert, where, from out
The forehead of a pollard oak,
    The leafy antlers sprout;

For She who planned the mossy lodge,
    Mistrusting her evasive skill,
Had to a Primrose looked for aid
    Her wishes to fulfill.

High on the trunk's projecting brow,
    And fixed an infant's span above
The budding flowers, peeped forth the nest
    The prettiest of the grove!

The treasure proudly did I show
    To some whose minds without disdain
Can turn to little things; but once
    Looked up for it in vain:

'Tis gone---a ruthless spoiler's prey,
    Who heeds not beauty, love, or song,
'Tis gone! (so seemed it) and we grieved
    Indignant at the wrong.

Just three days after, passing by
    In clearer light the moss-built cell
I saw, espied its shaded mouth;
    And felt that all was well.

The Primrose for a veil had spread
    The largest of her upright leaves;
And thus, for purposes benign,
    A simple flower deceives.

Concealed from friends who might disturb
    Thy quiet with no ill intent,
Secure from evil eyes and hands
    On barbarous plunder bent,

Rest, Mother-bird! and when thy young
    Take flight, and thou art free to roam,
When withered is the guardian Flower,
    And empty thy late home,

Think how ye prospered, thou and thine,
    Amid the unviolated grove
Housed near the growing Primrose-tuft
    In foresight, or in love."
10,After-Thought,".   I thought of Thee, my partner and my guide,
   As being past away.--Vain sympathies!
   For, backward, Duddon! as I cast my eyes,
   I see what was, and is, and will abide;
   Still glides the Stream, and shall for ever glide;
   The Form remains, the Function never dies;
   While we, the brave, the mighty, and the wise,
   We Men, who in our morn of youth defied
   The elements, must vanish;--be it so!
  Enough, if something from our hands have power
  To live, and act, and serve the future hour;
  And if, as toward the silent tomb we go,
  Through love, through hope, and faith's transcendent dower,
  We feel that we are greater than we know."
11,Anecdote For Fathers,"I HAVE a boy of five years old;
His face is fair and fresh to see;
His limbs are cast in beauty's mold
And dearly he loves me.

One morn we strolled on our dry walk,
Or quiet home all full in view,
And held such intermitted talk
As we are wont to do.

My thoughts on former pleasures ran;
I thought of Kilve's delightful shore,
Our pleasant home when spring began,
A long, long year before.

A day it was when I could bear
Some fond regrets to entertain;
With so much happiness to spare,
I could not feel a pain.

The green earth echoed to the feet
Of lambs that bounded through the glade,
From shade to sunshine, and as fleet
From sunshine back to shade.

Birds warbled round me---and each trace
Of inward sadness had its charm;
Kilve, thought I, was a favoured place,
And so is Liswyn farm.

My boy beside me tripped, so slim
And graceful in his rustic dress!
And, as we talked, I questioned him,
In very idleness.

""Now tell me, had you rather be,""
I said. and took him by the arm,
""On Kilve's smooth shore, by the green sea,
Or here at Liswyn farm?""

In careless mood he looked at me,
While still I held him by the arm,
And said, ""At Kilve I'd rather be
Than here at Liswyn farm.""

""Now, little Edward, say why so:
My little Edward, tell me why.""---
""I cannot tell, I do not know.""---
""Why, this is strange,"" said I;

""For, here are woods, hills smooth and warm:
There surely must one reason be
Why you would change sweet Liswyn farm
For Kilve by the green sea.""

At this, my boy hung down his head,
He blushed with shame, nor made reply;
And three times to the child I said,
""Why, :Edward, tell me why?""

His head he raised---there was in sight,
It caught his eye, he saw it plain---
Upon the house-top, glittering bright,
A broad and gilded vane.

Then did the boy his tongue unlock,
And eased his mind with this reply:
""At Kilve there was no weather-cock;
And that's the reason why.""

O dearest, dearest boy! my heart
For better lore would seldom yearn,
Could I but teach the hundredth part
Of what from thee I learn."
12,Animal Tranquility and Decay,"The little hedgerow birds,
That peck along the roads, regard him not.
He travels on, and in his face, his step,
His gait, is one expression: every limb,
His look and bending figure, all bespeak
A man who does not move with pain, but moves
With thought.--He is insensibly subdued
To settled quiet: he is one by whom
All effort seems forgotten; one to whom
Long patience hath such mild composure given,
That patience now doth seem a thing of which
He hath no need. He is by nature led
To peace so perfect that the young behold
With envy, what the Old Man hardly feels."
13,By the Seaside,"The sun is couched, the sea-fowl gone to rest,
And the wild storm hath somewhere found a nest;
Air slumbers--wave with wave no longer strives,
Only a heaving of the deep survives,
A tell-tale motion! soon will it be laid,
And by the tide alone the water swayed.
Stealthy withdrawings, interminglings mild
Of light with shade in beauty reconciled--
Such is the prospect far as sight can range,
The soothing recompence, the welcome change.
Where, now, the ships that drove before the blast,
Threatened by angry breakers as they passed;
And by a train of flying clouds bemocked;
Or, in the hollow surge, at anchor rocked
As on a bed of death? Some lodge in peace,
Saved by His care who bade the tempest cease;
And some, too heedless of past danger, court
Fresh gales to waft them to the far-off port
But near, or hanging sea and sky between,
Not one of all those winged powers is seen,
Seen in her course, nor 'mid this quiet heard;
Yet oh! how gladly would the air be stirred
By some acknowledgment of thanks and praise,
Soft in its temper as those vesper lays
Sung to the Virgin while accordant oars
Urge the slow bark along Calabrian shores;
A sea-born service through the mountains felt
Till into one loved vision all things melt:
Or like those hymns that soothe with graver sound
The gulfy coast of Norway iron-bound;
And, from the wide and open Baltic, rise
With punctual care, Lutherian harmonies.
Hush, not a voice is here! but why repine,
Now when the star of eve comes forth to shine
On British waters with that look benign?
Ye mariners, that plough your onward way,
Or in the haven rest, or sheltering bay,
May silent thanks at least to God be given
With a full heart; ""our thoughts are 'heard' in heaven."""
14,Calm is all Nature as a Resting Wheel,"Calm is all nature as a resting wheel.
The kine are couched upon the dewy grass;
The horse alone, seen dimly as I pass,
Is cropping audibly his later meal:
Dark is the ground; a slumber seems to steal
O'er vale, and mountain, and the starless sky.
Now, in this blank of things, a harmony,
Home-felt, and home-created, comes to heal
That grief for which the senses still supply
Fresh food; for only then, when memory
Is hushed, am I at rest. My Friends! restrain
Those busy cares that would allay my pain;
Oh! leave me to myself, nor let me feel
The officious touch that makes me droop again."
15,Character of the Happy Warrior,".   Who is the happy Warrior? Who is he
   That every man in arms should wish to be?
   --It is the generous Spirit, who, when brought
   Among the tasks of real life, hath wrought
   Upon the plan that pleased his boyish thought:
   Whose high endeavours are an inward light
   That makes the path before him always bright;
   Who, with a natural instinct to discern
   What knowledge can perform, is diligent to learn;
  Abides by this resolve, and stops not there,
  But makes his moral being his prime care;
  Who, doomed to go in company with Pain,
  And Fear, and Bloodshed, miserable train!
  Turns his necessity to glorious gain;
  In face of these doth exercise a power
  Which is our human nature's highest dower:
  Controls them and subdues, transmutes, bereaves
  Of their bad influence, and their good receives:
  By objects, which might force the soul to abate
  Her feeling, rendered more compassionate;
  Is placable--because occasions rise
  So often that demand such sacrifice;
  More skilful in self-knowledge, even more pure,
  As tempted more; more able to endure,
  As more exposed to suffering and distress;
  Thence, also, more alive to tenderness.
  --'Tis he whose law is reason; who depends
  Upon that law as on the best of friends;
  Whence, in a state where men are tempted still
  To evil for a guard against worse ill,
  And what in quality or act is best
  Doth seldom on a right foundation rest,
  He labours good on good to fix, and owes
  To virtue every triumph that he knows:
  --Who, if he rise to station of command,
  Rises by open means; and there will stand
  On honourable terms, or else retire,
  And in himself possess his own desire;
  Who comprehends his trust, and to the same
  Keeps faithful with a singleness of aim;
  And therefore does not stoop, nor lie in wait
  For wealth, or honours, or for worldly state;
  Whom they must follow; on whose head must fall,
  Like showers of manna, if they come at all:
  Whose powers shed round him in the common strife,
  Or mild concerns of ordinary life,
  A constant influence, a peculiar grace;
  But who, if he be called upon to face
  Some awful moment to which Heaven has joined
  Great issues, good or bad for human kind,
  Is happy as a Lover; and attired
  With sudden brightness, like a Man inspired;
  And, through the heat of conflict, keeps the law
  In calmness made, and sees what he foresaw;
  Or if an unexpected call succeed,
  Come when it will, is equal to the need:
  --He who, though thus endued as with a sense
  And faculty for storm and turbulence,
  Is yet a Soul whose master-bias leans
  To homefelt pleasures and to gentle scenes;
  Sweet images! which, wheresoe'er he be,
  Are at his heart; and such fidelity
  It is his darling passion to approve;
  More brave for this, that he hath much to love:--
  'Tis, finally, the Man, who, lifted high,
  Conspicuous object in a Nation's eye,
  Or left unthought-of in obscurity,--
  Who, with a toward or untoward lot,
  Prosperous or adverse, to his wish or not--
  Plays, in the many games of life, that one
  Where what he most doth value must be won:
  Whom neither shape or danger can dismay,
  Nor thought of tender happiness betray;
  Who, not content that former worth stand fast,
  Looks forward, persevering to the last,
  From well to better, daily self-surpast:
  Who, whether praise of him must walk the earth
  For ever, and to noble deeds give birth,
  Or he must fall, to sleep without his fame,
  And leave a dead unprofitable name--
  Finds comfort in himself and in his cause;
  And, while the mortal mist is gathering, draws
  His breath in confidence of Heaven's applause:
  This is the happy Warrior; this is he
  That every man in arms should wish to be."
16,Composed During a Storm,"One who was suffering tumult in his soul,
Yet failed to seek the sure relief of prayer,
Went forth--his course surrendering to the care
Of the fierce wind, while mid-day lightnings prowl
Insidiously, untimely thunders growl;
While trees, dim-seen, in frenzied numbers, tear
The lingering remnant of their yellow hair,
And shivering wolves, surprised with darkness, howl
As if the sun were not. He raised his eye
Soul-smitten; for, that instant, did appear
Large space ('mid dreadful clouds) of purest sky,
An azure disc--shield of Tranquillity;
Invisible, unlooked-for, minister
Of providential goodness ever nigh!"
17,Composed upon Westminster Bridge...,"Earth has not anything to show more fair:
   Dull would he be of soul who could pass by
   A sight so touching in its majesty:
   This City now doth, like a garment, wear
   The beauty of the morning; silent, bare,
   Ships, towers, domes, theatres, and temples lie
   Open unto the fields, and to the sky;
   All bright and glittering in the smokeless air.
   Never did sun more beautifully steep
  In his first splendour, valley, rock, or hill;
  Ne'er saw I, never felt, a calm so deep!
  The river glideth at his own sweet will:
  Dear God! the very houses seem asleep;
  And all that mighty heart is lying still!"
18,Dion,".  See Plutarch.
    Serene, and fitted to embrace,
   Where'er he turned, a swan-like grace
   Of haughtiness without pretence,
   And to unfold a still magnificence,
   Was princely Dion, in the power
   And beauty of his happier hour.
   And what pure homage then did wait
   On Dion's virtues, while the lunar beam
   Of Plato's genius, from its lofty sphere,
  Fell round him in the grove of Academe,
  Softening their inbred dignity austere--
    That he, not too elate
    With self-sufficing solitude,
  But with majestic lowliness endued,
  Might in the universal bosom reign,
  And from affectionate observance gain
  Help, under every change of adverse fate.

   Five thousand warriors--O the rapturous day!
  Each crowned with flowers, and armed with spear and shield,
  Or ruder weapon which their course might yield,
  To Syracuse advance in bright array.
  Who leads them on?--The anxious people see
  Long-exiled Dion marching at their head,
  He also crowned with flowers of Sicily,
  And in a white, far-beaming, corslet clad!
  Pure transport undisturbed by doubt or fear
  The gazers feel; and, rushing to the plain,
  Salute those strangers as a holy train
  Or blest procession (to the Immortals dear)
  That brought their precious liberty again.
  Lo! when the gates are entered, on each hand,
  Down the long street, rich goblets filled with wine
    In seemly order stand,
  On tables set, as if for rites divine;--
  And, as the great Deliverer marches by,
  He looks on festal ground with fruits bestrown;
  And flowers are on his person thrown
    In boundless prodigality;
  Nor doth the general voice abstain from prayer,
  Invoking Dion's tutelary care,
  As if a very Deity he were!

   Mourn, hills and groves of Attica! and mourn,
  Ilissus, bending o'er thy classic urn!
  Mourn, and lament for him whose spirit dreads
  Your once sweet memory, studious walks and shades!
  For him who to divinity aspired,
  Not on the breath of popular applause,
  But through dependence on the sacred laws
  Framed in the schools where Wisdom dwelt retired,
  Intent to trace the ideal path of right
  (More fair than heaven's broad causeway paved with stars)
  Which Dion learned to measure with sublime delight;--
  But He hath overleaped the eternal bars;
  And, following guides whose craft holds no consent
  With aught that breathes the ethereal element,
  Hath stained the robes of civil power with blood,
  Unjustly shed, though for the public good.
  Whence doubts that came too late, and wishes vain,
  Hollow excuses, and triumphant pain;
  And oft his cogitations sink as low
  As, through the abysses of a joyless heart,
  The heaviest plummet of despair can go--
  But whence that sudden check? that fearful start!
    He hears an uncouth sound--
    Anon his lifted eyes
  Saw, at a long-drawn gallery's dusky bound,
  A Shape of more than mortal size
  And hideous aspect, stalking round and round!
    A woman's garb the Phantom wore,
    And fiercely swept the marble floor,--
    Like Auster whirling to and fro,
    His force on Caspian foam to try;
  Or Boreas when he scours the snow
  That skims the plains of Thessaly,
  Or when aloft on Mænalus he stops
  His flight, 'mid eddying pine-tree tops!

   So, but from toil less sign of profit reaping,
  The sullen Spectre to her purpose bowed,
  Sweeping--vehemently sweeping--
  No pause admitted, no design avowed!
  ""Avaunt, inexplicable Guest!--avaunt,""
  Exclaimed the Chieftain--""let me rather see
  The coronal that coiling vipers make;
  The torch that flames with many a lurid flake,
  And the long train of doleful pageantry
  Which they behold, whom vengeful Furies haunt;
  Who, while they struggle from the scourge to flee,
  Move where the blasted soil is not unworn,
  And, in their anguish, bear what other minds have borne!""

   But Shapes, that come not at an earthly call,
  Will not depart when mortal voices bid;
  Lords of the visionary eye whose lid,
  Once raised, remains aghast, and will not fall!
  Ye Gods, thought He, that servile Implement
    Obeys a mystical intent!
  Your Minister would brush away
  The spots that to my soul adhere;
  But should she labour night and day,
  They will not, cannot disappear;
  Whence angry perturbations,--and that look
  Which no philosophy can brook!


   Ill-fated Chief! there are whose hopes are built
  Upon the ruins of thy glorious name;
  Who, through the portal of one moment's guilt,
  Pursue thee with their deadly aim!
  O matchless perfidy! portentous lust
  Of monstrous crime!--that horror-striking blade,
  Drawn in defiance of the Gods, hath laid
  The noble Syracusan low in dust!
  Shudder'd the walls--the marble city wept--
  And sylvan places heaved a pensive sigh;
  But in calm peace the appointed Victim slept,
  As he had fallen in magnanimity;
  Of spirit too capacious to require
  That Destiny her course should change; too just
  To his own native greatness to desire
  That wretched boon, days lengthened by mistrust.
  So were the hopeless troubles, that involved
  The soul of Dion, instantly dissolved.
  Released from life and cares of princely state,
  He left this moral grafted on his Fate;
  ""Him only pleasure leads, and peace attends,
  Him, only him, the shield of Jove defends,
  Whose means are fair and spotless as his ends."""
19,Elegiac Stanzas Suggested by a Picture of Peele Castle,". I was thy neighbour once, thou rugged Pile!
   Four summer weeks I dwelt in sight of thee:
   I saw thee every day; and all the while
   Thy Form was sleeping on a glassy sea.
   So pure the sky, so quiet was the air!
   So like, so very like, was day to day!
   Whene'er I looked, thy Image still was there;
   It trembled, but it never passed away.
   How perfect was the calm! it seemed no sleep;
  No mood, which season takes away, or brings:
  I could have fancied that the mighty Deep
  Was even the gentlest of all gentle things.

  Ah!  then , if mine had been the Painter's hand,
  To express what then I saw; and add the gleam,
  The light that never was, on sea or land,
  The consecration, and the Poet's dream;

  I would have planted thee, thou hoary Pile
  Amid a world how different from this!
  Beside a sea that could not cease to smile;
  On tranquil land, beneath a sky of bliss.

  Thou shouldst have seemed a treasure-house divine
  Of peaceful years; a chronicle of heaven;--
  Of all the sunbeams that did ever shine
  The very sweetest had to thee been given.

  A Picture had it been of lasting ease,
  Elysian quiet, without toil or strife;
  No motion but the moving tide, a breeze,
  Or merely silent Nature's breathing life.

  Such, in the fond illusion of my heart,
  Such Picture would I at that time have made:
  And seen the soul of truth in every part,
  A steadfast peace that might not be betrayed.

  So once it would have been,--'tis so no more;
  I have submitted to a new control:
  A power is gone, which nothing can restore;
  A deep distress hath humanised my Soul.

  Not for a moment could I now behold
  A smiling sea, and be what I have been:
  The feeling of my loss will ne'er be old;
  This, which I know, I speak with mind serene.

  Then, Beaumont, Friend! who would have been the Friend,
  If he had lived, of Him whom I deplore,
  This work of thine I blame not, but commend;
  This sea in anger, and that dismal shore.

  O 'tis a passionate Work!--yet wise and well,
  Well chosen is the spirit that is here;
  That Hulk which labours in the deadly swell,
  This rueful sky, this pageantry of fear!

  And this huge Castle, standing here sublime,
  I love to see the look with which it braves,
  Cased in the unfeeling armour of old time,
  The lightning, the fierce wind, the trampling waves.

  Farewell, farewell the heart that lives alone,
  Housed in a dream, at distance from the Kind!
  Such happiness, wherever it be known,
  Is to be pitied; for 'tis surely blind.

  But welcome fortitude, and patient cheer,
  And frequent sights of what is to be borne!
  Such sights, or worse, as are before me here.--
   Not without hope we suffer and we mourn."
20,Expostulation and Reply,"""Why, William, on that old gray stone,
Thus for the length of half a day,
Why, William, sit you thus alone,
And dream your time away?

""Where are your books? -- that light bequeathed
To Beings else forlorn and blind!
Up! up! and drink the spirit breathed
From dead men to their kind.

""You look round on your Mother Earth,
As if she for no purpose bore you;
As if you were her first-born birth,
And none had lived before you!""

One morning thus, by Esthwaite lake,
When life was sweet, I knew not why,
To me my good friend Matthew spake,
And thus I made reply:--

""The eye -- it cannot choose but see;
We cannot bid the ear be still;
Our bodies feel, where'er they be,
Against or with our will.

""Nor less I deem that there are Powers
Which of themselves our minds impress;
That we can feed this mind of ours
In a wise passiveness.

""Think you, 'mid all this mighty sum
Of things forever speaking,
That nothing of itself will come
But we must still be seeking?

""Then ask not wherefore, here, alone,
Conversing as I may,
I sit upon this old gray stone,
And dream my time away."""
21,Extempore Effusion upon the Death of James Hogg,".  When first, descending from the moorlands,
   I saw the Stream of Yarrow glide
   Along a bare and open valley,
   The Ettrick Shepherd was my guide.
   When last along its banks I wandered,
   Through groves that had begun to shed
   Their golden leaves upon the pathways,
   My steps the Border-minstrel led.
   The mighty Minstrel breathes no longer,
  'Mid mouldering ruins low he lies;
  And death upon the braes of Yarrow,
  Has closed the Shepherd-poet's eyes:

  Nor has the rolling year twice measured,
  From sign to sign, its stedfast course,
  Since every mortal power of Coleridge
  Was frozen at its marvellous source;

  The rapt One, of the godlike forehead,
  The heaven-eyed creature sleeps in earth:
  And Lamb, the frolic and the gentle,
  Has vanished from his lonely hearth.

  Like clouds that rake the mountain-summits,
  Or waves that own no curbing hand,
  How fast has brother followed brother,
  From sunshine to the sunless land!

  Yet I, whose lids from infant slumber
  Were earlier raised, remain to hear
  A timid voice, that asks in whispers,
  ""Who next will drop and disappear?""

  Our haughty life is crowned with darkness,
  Like London with its own black wreath,
  On which with thee, O Crabbe! forth-looking,
  I gazed from Hampstead's breezy heath.

  As if but yesterday departed,
  Thou too art gone before; but why,
  O'er ripe fruit, seasonably gathered,
  Should frail survivors heave a sigh?

  Mourn rather for that holy Spirit,
  Sweet as the spring, as ocean deep;
  For Her who, ere her summer faded,
  Has sunk into a breathless sleep.

  No more of old romantic sorrows,
  For slaughtered Youth or love-lorn Maid!
  With sharper grief is Yarrow smitten,
  And Ettrick mourns with her their Poet dead."
22,Foresight,"That is work of waste and ruin--
Do as Charles and I are doing!
Strawberry-blossoms, one and all,
We must spare them--here are many:
Look at it--the flower is small,
Small and low, though fair as any:
Do not touch it! summers two
I am older, Anne, than you.

Pull the primrose, sister Anne!
Pull as many as you can.
--Here are daisies, take your fill;
Pansies, and the cuckoo-flower:
Of the lofty daffodil
Make your bed, or make your bower;
Fill your lap, and fill your bosom;
Only spare the strawberry-blossom!

Primroses, the Spring may love them--
Summer knows but little of them:
Violets, a barren kind,
Withered on the ground must lie;
Daisies leave no fruit behind
When the pretty flowerets die;
Pluck them, and another year
As many will be blowing here.

God has given a kindlier power
To the favoured strawberry-flower.
Hither soon as spring is fled
You and Charles and I will walk;
Lurking berries, ripe and red,
Then will hang on every stalk,
Each within its leafy bower;
And for that promise spare the flower!"
23,I Know an Old Man Constrained to Dwell,"I know an aged Man constrained to dwell
In a large house of public charity,
Where he abides, as in a Prisoner's cell,
With numbers near, alas! no company.

When he could creep about, at will, though poor
And forced to live on alms, this old Man fed
A Redbreast, one that to his cottage door
Came not, but in a lane partook his bread.

There, at the root of one particular tree,
An easy seat this worn-out Labourer found
While Robin pecked the crumbs upon his knee
Laid one by one, or scattered on the ground.

Dear intercourse was theirs, day after day;
What signs of mutual gladness when they met!
Think of their common peace, their simple play,
The parting moment and its fond regret.

Months passed in love that failed not to fulfil,
In spite of season's change, its own demand,
By fluttering pinions here and busy bill;
There by caresses from a tremulous hand.

Thus in the chosen spot a tie so strong
Was formed between the solitary pair,
That when his fate had housed him 'mid a throng
The Captive shunned all converse proffered there.

Wife, children, kindred, they were dead and gone;
But, if no evil hap his wishes crossed,
One living Stay was left, and on that one
Some recompence for all that he had lost.

Oh that the good old Man had power to prove,
By message sent through air or visible token,
That still he loves the Bird, and still must love;
That friendship lasts though fellowship is broken!"
24,Influence of Natural Objects,"In Calling Forth and Strengthening the Imagination
in Boyhood and Early Youth

Wisdom and Spirit of the Universe!
Thou Soul, that art the Eternity of thought!
And giv'st to forms and images a breath
And everlasting motion! not in vain,
By day or star-light, thus from my first dawn
Of childhood didst thou intertwine for me
The passions that build up our human soul,
Not with the mean and vulgar works of man,
But with high objects, with enduring things,
With life and nature; purifying thus
The elements of feeling and of thought,
And sanctifying by such discipline
Both pain and fear, -until we recognize
A grandeur in the beatings of the heart.
Nor was this fellowship vouchsafed to me
With stinted kindness. In November days,
When vapours rolling down the valleys made
A lonely scene more lonesome; among woods
At noon; and mid the calm of summer nights,
When, by the margin of the trembling Lake,
Beneath the gloomy hills, I homeward went
In solitude, such intercourse was mine:
'Twas mine among the fields both day and night,
And by the waters, all the summer long.
And in the frosty season, when the sun
Was set, and, visible for many a mile,
The cottage windows through the twilight blazed,
I heeded not the summons: -happy time
It was indeed for all of us; for me
It was a time of rapture! -Clear and loud
The village clock tolled six -I wheeled about,
Proud and exulting like an untired horse
That cares not for his home. -All shod with steel
We hissed along the polished ice, in games
Confederate, imitative of the chase
And woodland pleasures, -the resounding horn,
The pack loud-bellowing, and the hunted hare.
So through the darkness and the cold we flew,
And not a voice was idle: with the din
Meanwhile the precipices rang aloud;
The leafless trees and every icy crag
Tinkled like iron; while the distant hills
Into the tumult sent an alien sound
Of melancholy, not unnoticed, while the stars,
Eastward, were sparkling clear, and in the west
The orange sky of evening died away.

Not seldom from the uproar I retired
Into a silent bay, -or sportively
Glanced sideway, leaving the tumultuous throng,
To cut across the reflex of a Star;
Image that, flying still before me, gleamed
Upon the glassy plain: and oftentimes,
When we had given our bodies to the wind,
And all the shadowy banks on either side
Came sweeping through the darkness, spinning still
The rapid line of motion, then at once
Have I, reclining back upon my heels,
Stopped short; yet still the solitary cliffs
Wheeled by me -even as if the earth had rolled
With visible motion her diurnal round!
Behind me did they stretch in solemn train,
Feebler and feebler, and I stood and watched
Till all was tranquil as a summer sea."
25,Inscriptions Written with a Slate Pencil upon a Stone,"Stranger! this hillock of mis-shapen stones
Is not a Ruin spared or made by time,
Nor, as perchance thou rashly deem'st, the Cairn
Of some old British Chief: 'tis nothing more
Than the rude embryo of a little Dome
Or Pleasure-house, once destined to be built
Among the birch-trees of this rocky isle.
But, as it chanced, Sir William having learned
That from the shore a full-grown man might wade,
And make himself a freeman of this spot
At any hour he chose, the prudent Knight
Desisted, and the quarry and the mound
Are monuments of his unfinished task.
The block on which these lines are traced, perhaps,
Was once selected as the corner-stone
Of that intended Pile, which would have been
Some quaint odd plaything of elaborate skill,
So that, I guess, the linnet and the thrush,
And other little builders who dwell here,
Had wondered at the work. But blame him not,
For old Sir William was a gentle Knight,
Bled in this vale, to which he appertained
With all his ancestry. Then peace to him,
And for the outrage which he had devised
Entire forgiveness!--But if thou art one
On fire with thy impatience to become
An inmate of these mountains,--if, disturbed
By beautiful conceptions, thou hast hewn
Out of the quiet rock the elements
Of thy trim Mansion destined soon to blaze
In snow-white splendour,--think again; and, taught
By old Sir William and his quarry, leave
Thy fragments to the bramble and the rose;
There let the vernal slow-worm sun himself,
And let the redbreast hop from stone to stone."
26,"Inside of King's College Chapel, Cambridge",".   Tax not the royal Saint with vain expense,
   With ill-matched aims the Architect who planned--
   Albeit labouring for a scanty band
   Of white-robed Scholars only--this immense
   And glorious Work of fine intelligence!
   Give all thou canst; high Heaven rejects the lore
   Of nicely-calculated less or more;
   So deemed the man who fashioned for the sense
   These lofty pillars, spread that branching roof
  Self-poised, and scooped into ten thousand cells,
  Where light and shade repose, where music dwells
  Lingering--and wandering on as loth to die;
  Like thoughts whose very sweetness yieldeth proof
  That they were born for immortality."
27,It Is a Beauteous Evening,"It is a beauteous evening, calm and free,
The holy time is quiet as a nun
Breathless with adoration; the broad sun
Is sinking down in its tranquility;
The gentleness of heaven broods o'er the sea:
Listen! the mighty Being is awake,
And doth with his eternal motion make
A sound like thunder - everlastingly.
Dear Child! dear Girl! that walkest with me here,
If thou appear untouched by solemn thought,
Thy nature is not therefore less divine:
Thou liest in Abraham's bosom all the year,
And worship'st at the Temple's inner shrine,
God being with thee when we know it not."
28,It is not to be Thought of,".   It is not to be thought of that the Flood
   Of British freedom, which, to the open sea
   Of the world's praise, from dark antiquity
   Hath flowed, ""with pomp of waters, unwithstood,""
   Roused though it be full often to a mood
   Which spurns the check of salutary bands,
   That this most famous Stream in bogs and sands
   Should perish; and to evil and to good
   Be lost for ever. In our halls is hung
  Armoury of the invincible Knights of old:
  We must be free or die, who speak the tongue
  That Shakespeare spake; the faith and morals hold
  Which Milton held.--In every thing we are sprung
  Of Earth's first blood, have titles manifold."
29,It was an April morning: fresh and clear,"It was an April morning: fresh and clear
The Rivulet, delighting in its strength,
Ran with a young man's speed; and yet the voice
Of waters which the winter had supplied
Was softened down into a vernal tone.
The spirit of enjoyment and desire,
And hopes and wishes, from all living things
Went circling, like a multitude of sounds.
The budding groves seemed eager to urge on
The steps of June; as if their various hues
Were only hindrances that stood between
Them and their object: but, meanwhile, prevailed
Such an entire contentment in the air
That every naked ash, and tardy tree
Yet leafless, showed as if the countenance
With which it looked on this delightful day
Were native to the summer.--Up the brook
I roamed in the confusion of my heart,
Alive to all things and forgetting all.
At length I to a sudden turning came
In this continuous glen, where down a rock
The Stream, so ardent in its course before,
Sent forth such sallies of glad sound, that all
Which I till then had heard, appeared the voice
Of common pleasure: beast and bird, the lamb,
The shepherd's dog, the linnet and the thrush
Vied with this waterfall, and made a song,
Which, while I listened, seemed like the wild growth
Or like some natural produce of the air,
That could not cease to be. Green leaves were here;
But 'twas the foliage of the rocks--the birch,
The yew, the holly, and the bright green thorn,
With hanging islands of resplendent furze:
And, on a summit, distant a short space,
By any who should look beyond the dell,
A single mountain-cottage might be seen.
I gazed and gazed, and to myself I said,
""Our thoughts at least are ours; and this wild nook,
My EMMA, I will dedicate to thee.""
----Soon did the spot become my other home,
My dwelling, and my out-of-doors abode.
And, of the Shepherds who have seen me there,
To whom I sometimes in our idle talk
Have told this fancy, two or three, perhaps,
Years after we are gone and in our graves,
When they have cause to speak of this wild place,
May call it by the name of EMMA'S DELL."
30,Lament Of Mary Queen Of Scots,"SMILE of the Moon!---for I so name
That silent greeting from above;
A gentle flash of light that came
From her whom drooping captives love;
Or art thou of still higher birth?
Thou that didst part the clouds of earth,
My torpor to reprove!

Bright boon of pitying Heaven!---alas,
I may not trust thy placid cheer!
Pondering that Time tonight will pass
The threshold of another year;
For years to me are sad and dull;
My very moments are too full
Of hopelessness and fear.

And yet, the soul-awakening gleam,
That struck perchance the farthest cone
Of Scotland's rocky wilds, did seem
To visit me, and me alone;
Me, unapproached by any friend,
Save those who to my sorrow lend
Tears due unto their own.

To night the church-tower bells will ring
Through these wide realms a festire peal;
To the new year a welcoming;
A tuneful offering for the weal
Of happy millions lulled in deep;
While I am forced to watch and weep,
By wounds that may not heal.

Born all too high, by wedlock raised
Still higherÑto be cast thus low!
Would that mine eyes had never gazed
On aught of more ambitious show
Than the sweet flowerets of the fields
---It is my royal state that yields
This bitterness of woe.

Yet how?---for I, if there be truth
In the world's voice, was passing fair;
And beauty, for confiding youth,
Those shocks of passion can prepare
That kill the bloom before its time;
And blanch, without the owner's crime,
The most resplendent hair.

Unblest distinction! showered on me
To bind a lingering life in chains:
All that could quit my grasp, or flee,
Is gone;---but not the subtle stains
Fixed in the spirit; for even here
Can I be proud that jealous fear
Of what I was remains.

A Woman rules my prison's key;
A sister Queen, against the bent
O£ law and holiest sympathy,
Detains me, doubtful of the event;
Great God, who feel'st for my distress,
My thoughts are all that I possess,
O keep them innocent!

Farewell desire of human aid,
Which abject mortals vainly court!
By friends deceived, by foes betrayed,
Of fears the prey, of hopes the sport;
Nought but the world-redeeming Cross
Is able to support my loss,
My burthen to support.

Hark! the death-note of the year
Sounded by the castle-clock!
From her sunk eyes a stagnant tear
Stole forth, unsettled by the shock;
But oft the woods renewed their green,
Ere the tired head of Scotland's Queen
Reposed upon the block!"
31,Laodamia,".  ""With sacrifice before the rising morn
   Vows have I made by fruitless hope inspired;
   And from the infernal Gods, 'mid shades forlorn
   Of night, my slaughtered Lord have I required:
   Celestial pity I again implore;--
   Restore him to my sight--great Jove, restore!""
   So speaking, and by fervent love endowed
   With faith, the Suppliant heavenward lifts her hands;
   While, like the sun emerging from a cloud,
  Her countenance brightens--and her eye expands;
  Her bosom heaves and spreads, her stature grows;
  As she expects the issue in repose.

  O terror! what hath she perceived?--O joy!
  What doth she look on?--whom doth she behold?
  Her Hero slain upon the beach of Troy?
  His vital presence? his corporeal mould?
  It is--if sense deceive her not--'tis He!
  And a God leads him, wingèd Mercury!

  Mild Hermes spake--and touched her with his wand
  That calms all fear; ""Such grace hath crowned thy prayer,
  Laodamía! that at Jove's command
  Thy husband walks the paths of upper air:
  He comes to tarry with thee three hours' space;
  Accept the gift, behold him face to face!""

  Forth sprang the impassioned Queen her Lord to clasp;
  Again that consummation she essayed;
  But unsubstantial Form eludes her grasp
  As often as that eager grasp was made.
  The Phantom parts--but parts to re-unite,
  And re-assume his place before her sight.

  ""Protesiláus, lo! thy guide is gone!
  Confirm, I pray, the vision with thy voice:
  This is our palace,--yonder is thy throne;
  Speak, and the floor thou tread'st on will rejoice.
  Not to appal me have the gods bestowed
  This precious boon; and blest a sad abode.""

  ""Great Jove, Laodamía! doth not leave
  His gifts imperfect:--Spectre though I be,
  I am not sent to scare thee or deceive;
  But in reward of thy fidelity.
  And something also did my worth obtain;
  For fearless virtue bringeth boundless gain.

  ""Thou knowest, the Delphic oracle foretold
  That the first Greek who touched the Trojan strand
  Should die; but me the threat could not withhold:
  A generous cause a victim did demand;
  And forth I leapt upon the sandy plain;
  A self-devoted chief--by Hector slain.""

  ""Supreme of Heroes--bravest, noblest, best!
  Thy matchless courage I bewail no more,
  Which then, when tens of thousands were deprest
  By doubt, propelled thee to the fatal shore;
  Thou found'st--and I forgive thee--here thou art--
  A nobler counsellor than my poor heart.

  ""But thou, though capable of sternest deed,
  Wert kind as resolute, and good as brave;
  And he, whose power restores thee, hath decreed
  Thou should'st elude the malice of the grave:
  Redundant are thy locks, thy lips as fair
   As when their breath enriched Thessalian air.

  ""No spectre greets me,--no vain Shadow this;
  Come, blooming Hero, place thee by my side!
  Give, on this well-known couch, one nuptial kiss
  To me, this day a second time thy bride!""
  Jove frowned in heaven: the conscious Parcæ threw
  Upon those roseate lips a Stygian hue.

  ""This visage tells thee that my doom is past:
  Nor should the change be mourned, even if the joys
  Of sense were able to return as fast
  And surely as they vanish. Earth destroys
  Those raptures duly---Erebus disdains:
  Calm pleasures there abide--majestic pains.

  ""Be taught, O faithful Consort, to control
  Rebellious passion: for the Gods approve
  The depth, and not the tumult, of the soul;
  A fervent, not ungovernable love.
  Thy transports moderate; and meekly mourn
  When I depart, for brief is my sojourn--""

  ""Ah wherefore?--Did not Hercules by force
  Wrest from the guardian monster of the tomb
  Alcestis, a reanimated corse,
  Given back to dwell on earth in vernal bloom?
  Medea's spells dispersed the weight of years,
  And Æson stood a youth 'mid youthful peers.

  ""The Gods to us are merciful--and they
  Yet further may relent: for mightier far
  Than strength of nerve and sinew, or the sway
  Of magic potent over sun and star,
  Is love, though oft to agony distrest,
  And though his favourite seat be feeble woman's breast.

  ""But if thou goest, I follow--"" ""Peace!"" he said,--
  She looked upon him and was calmed and cheered;
  The ghastly colour from his lips had fled;
  In his deportment, shape, and mien, appeared
  Elysian beauty, melancholy grace,
  Brought from a pensive though a happy place.

  He spake of love, such love as Spirits feel
  In worlds whose course is equable and pure;
  No fears to beat away--no strife to heal--
 The past unsighed for, and the future sure;
 Spake of heroic arts in graver mood
 Revived, with finer harmony pursued;


 Of all that is most beauteous--imaged there
 In happier beauty; more pellucid streams,
 An ampler ether, a diviner air,
 And fields invested with purpureal gleams;
 Climes which the sun, who sheds the brightest day
 Earth knows, is all unworthy to survey.


 Yet there the Soul shall enter which hath earned
 That privilege by virtue.--""Ill,"" said he,
 ""The end of man's existence I discerned,
 Who from ignoble games and revelry
 Could draw, when we had parted, vain delight,
 While tears were thy best pastime, day and night;


 ""And while my youthful peers before my eyes
 (Each hero following his peculiar bent)
 Prepared themselves for glorious enterprise
 By martial sports,--or, seated in the tent,
 Chieftains and kings in council were detained;
 What time the fleet at Aulis lay enchained.


 ""The wished-for wind was given:--I then revolved
 The oracle, upon the silent sea;
 And, if no worthier led the way, resolved
 That, of a thousand vessels, mine should be
 The foremost prow in pressing to the strand,--
 Mine the first blood that tinged the Trojan sand.


 ""Yet bitter, oft-times bitter, was the pang
 When of thy loss I thought, belovèd Wife!
 On thee too fondly did my memory hang,
 And on the joys we shared in mortal life,--
 The paths which we had trod--these fountains, flowers:
 My new-planned cities, and unfinished towers.


 ""But should suspense permit the Foe to cry,
 'Behold they tremble!--haughty their array,
 Yet of their numbers no one dares to die?'
 In soul I swept the indignity away:
 Old frailties then recurred:--but lofty thought,
 In act embodied, my deliverance wrought.


 ""And Thou, though strong in love, art all too weak
 In reason, in self-government too slow;
 I counsel thee by fortitude to seek
 Our blest re-union in the shades below.
 The invisible world with thee hath sympathised;
 Be thy affections raised and solemnised.


 ""Learn, by a mortal yearning, to ascend--
 Seeking a higher object. Love was given,
 Encouraged, sanctioned, chiefly for that end;
 For this the passion to excess was driven--
 That self might be annulled: her bondage prove
 The fetters of a dream opposed to love.--


 Aloud she shrieked! for Hermes re-appears!
 Round the dear Shade she would have clung--'tis vain:
 The hours are past--too brief had they been years;
 And him no mortal effort can detain:
 Swift, toward the realms that know not earthly day,
 He through the portal takes his silent way,
 And on the palace-floor a lifeless corse She lay.


 Thus, all in vain exhorted and reproved,
 She perished; and, as for a wilful crime,
 By the just Gods whom no weak pity moved,
 Was doomed to wear out her appointed time,
 Apart from happy Ghosts, that gather flowers
 Of blissful quiet 'mid unfading bowers.


 --Yet tears to human suffering are due;
 And mortal hopes defeated and o'erthrown
 Are mourned by man, and not by man alone,
 As fondly he believes.--Upon the side
 Of Hellespont (such faith was entertained)
 A knot of spiry trees for ages grew
 From out the tomb of him for whom she died;
 And ever, when such stature they had gained
 That Ilium's walls were subject to their view,
 The trees' tall summits withered at the sight;
 A constant interchange of growth and blight!"
32,Lines Composed a Few Miles above Tintern Abbey,"Five years have past; five summers, with the length
Of five long winters! and again I hear
These waters, rolling from their mountain-springs
With a soft inland murmur.--Once again
Do I behold these steep and lofty cliffs,
That on a wild secluded scene impress
Thoughts of more deep seclusion; and connect
The landscape with the quiet of the sky.
The day is come when I again repose
Here, under this dark sycamore, and view
These plots of cottage-ground, these orchard-tufts,
Which at this season, with their unripe fruits,
Are clad in one green hue, and lose themselves
'Mid groves and copses. Once again I see
These hedge-rows, hardly hedge-rows, little lines
Of sportive wood run wild: these pastoral farms,
Green to the very door; and wreaths of smoke
Sent up, in silence, from among the trees!
With some uncertain notice, as might seem
Of vagrant dwellers in the houseless woods,
Or of some Hermit's cave, where by his fire
The Hermit sits alone. These beauteous forms,
Through a long absence, have not been to me
As is a landscape to a blind man's eye:
But oft, in lonely rooms, and 'mid the din
Of towns and cities, I have owed to them
In hours of weariness, sensations sweet,
Felt in the blood, and felt along the heart;
And passing even into my purer mind,
With tranquil restoration:--feelings too
Of unremembered pleasure: such, perhaps,
As have no slight or trivial influence
On that best portion of a good man's life,
His little, nameless, unremembered, acts
Of kindness and of love. Nor less, I trust,
To them I may have owed another gift,
Of aspect more sublime; that blessed mood,
In which the burthen of the mystery,
In which the heavy and the weary weight
Of all this unintelligible world,
Is lightened:--that serene and blessed mood,
In which the affections gently lead us on,--
Until, the breath of this corporeal frame
And even the motion of our human blood
Almost suspended, we are laid asleep
In body, and become a living soul:
While with an eye made quiet by the power
Of harmony, and the deep power of joy,
We see into the life of things. If this
Be but a vain belief, yet, oh! how oft--
In darkness and amid the many shapes
Of joyless daylight; when the fretful stir
Unprofitable, and the fever of the world,
Have hung upon the beatings of my heart--
How oft, in spirit, have I turned to thee,
O sylvan Wye! thou wanderer thro' the woods,
How often has my spirit turned to thee!
And now, with gleams of half-extinguished thought,
With many recognitions dim and faint,
And somewhat of a sad perplexity,
The picture of the mind revives again:
While here I stand, not only with the sense
Of present pleasure, but with pleasing thoughts
That in this moment there is life and food
For future years. And so I dare to hope,
Though changed, no doubt, from what I was when first
I came among these hills; when like a roe
I bounded o'er the mountains, by the sides
Of the deep rivers, and the lonely streams,
Wherever nature led: more like a man
Flying from something that he dreads, than one
Who sought the thing he loved. For nature then
(The coarser pleasures of my boyish days,
And their glad animal movements all gone by)
To me was all in all.--I cannot paint
What then I was. The sounding cataract
Haunted me like a passion: the tall rock,
The mountain, and the deep and gloomy wood,
Their colours and their forms, were then to me
An appetite; a feeling and a love,
That had no need of a remoter charm,
By thought supplied, nor any interest
Unborrowed from the eye.--That time is past,
And all its aching joys are now no more,
And all its dizzy raptures. Not for this
Faint I, nor mourn nor murmur, other gifts
Have followed; for such loss, I would believe,
Abundant recompence. For I have learned
To look on nature, not as in the hour
Of thoughtless youth; but hearing oftentimes
The still, sad music of humanity,
Nor harsh nor grating, though of ample power
To chasten and subdue. And I have felt
A presence that disturbs me with the joy
Of elevated thoughts; a sense sublime
Of something far more deeply interfused,
Whose dwelling is the light of setting suns,
And the round ocean and the living air,
And the blue sky, and in the mind of man;
A motion and a spirit, that impels
All thinking things, all objects of all thought,
And rolls through all things. Therefore am I still
A lover of the meadows and the woods,
And mountains; and of all that we behold
From this green earth; of all the mighty world
Of eye, and ear,--both what they half create,
And what perceive; well pleased to recognise
In nature and the language of the sense,
The anchor of my purest thoughts, the nurse,
The guide, the guardian of my heart, and soul
Of all my moral being. Nor perchance,
If I were not thus taught, should I the more
Suffer my genial spirits to decay:
For thou art with me here upon the banks
Of this fair river; thou my dearest Friend,
My dear, dear Friend; and in thy voice I catch
The language of my former heart, and read
My former pleasures in the shooting lights
Of thy wild eyes. Oh! yet a little while
May I behold in thee what I was once,
My dear, dear Sister! and this prayer I make,
Knowing that Nature never did betray
The heart that loved her; 'tis her privilege,
Through all the years of this our life, to lead
From joy to joy: for she can so inform
The mind that is within us, so impress
With quietness and beauty, and so feed
With lofty thoughts, that neither evil tongues,
Rash judgments, nor the sneers of selfish men,
Nor greetings where no kindness is, nor all
The dreary intercourse of daily life,
Shall e'er prevail against us, or disturb
Our cheerful faith, that all which we behold
Is full of blessings. Therefore let the moon
Shine on thee in thy solitary walk;
And let the misty mountain-winds be free
To blow against thee: and, in after years,
When these wild ecstasies shall be matured
Into a sober pleasure; when thy mind
Shall be a mansion for all lovely forms,
Thy memory be as a dwelling-place
For all sweet sounds and harmonies; oh! then,
If solitude, or fear, or pain, or grief,
Should be thy portion, with what healing thoughts
Of tender joy wilt thou remember me,
And these my exhortations! Nor, perchance--
If I should be where I no more can hear
Thy voice, nor catch from thy wild eyes these gleams
Of past existence--wilt thou then forget
That on the banks of this delightful stream
We stood together; and that I, so long
A worshipper of Nature, hither came
Unwearied in that service: rather say
With warmer love--oh! with far deeper zeal
Of holier love. Nor wilt thou then forget,
That after many wanderings, many years
Of absence, these steep woods and lofty cliffs,
And this green pastoral landscape, were to me
More dear, both for themselves and for thy sake!"
33,Lines Written In Early Spring,"I HEARD a thousand blended notes,
While in a grove I sate reclined,
In that sweet mood when pleasant thoughts
Bring sad thoughts to the mind.

To her fair works did Nature link
The human soul that through me ran;
And much it grieved my heart to think
What man has made of man.

Through primrose tufts, in that green bower,
The periwinkle trailed its wreaths;
And 'tis my faith that every flower
Enjoys the air it breathes.

The birds around me hopped and played,
Their thoughts I cannot measure:---
But the least motion which they made,
It seemed a thrill of pleasure.

The budding twigs spread out their fan,
To catch the breezy air;
And I must think, do all I can,
That there was pleasure there.

If this belief from heaven be sent,
If such be Nature's holy plan,
Have I not reason to lament
What man has made of man?"
34,"London, 1802","Milton! thou shouldst be living at this hour:
England hath need of thee: she is a fen
Of stagnant waters: altar, sword, and pen,
Fireside, the heroic wealth of hall and bower,
Have forfeited their ancient English dower
Of inward happiness. We are selfish men;
Oh! raise us up, return to us again;
And give us manners, virtue, freedom, power.
Thy soul was like a Star, and dwelt apart:
Thou hadst a voice whose sound was like the sea:
Pure as the naked heavens, majestic, free,
So didst thou travel on life's common way,
In cheerful godliness; and yet the heart
The lowliest duties on herself did lay."
35,Lucy Gray,"Oft I had heard of Lucy Gray,
And when I cross'd the Wild,
I chanc'd to see at break of day
The solitary Child.

No Mate, no comrade Lucy knew;
She dwelt on a wild Moor,
The sweetest Thing that ever grew
Beside a human door!

You yet may spy the Fawn at play,
The Hare upon the Green;
But the sweet face of Lucy Gray
Will never more be seen.

""To-night will be a stormy night,
You to the Town must go,
And take a lantern, Child, to light
Your Mother thro' the snow.""

""That, Father! will I gladly do;
'Tis scarcely afternoon--
The Minster-clock has just struck two,
And yonder is the Moon.""

At this the Father rais'd his hook
And snapp'd a faggot-band;
He plied his work, and Lucy took
The lantern in her hand.

Not blither is the mountain roe,
With many a wanton stroke
Her feet disperse, the powd'ry snow
That rises up like smoke.

The storm came on before its time,
She wander'd up and down,
And many a hill did Lucy climb
But never reach'd the Town.

The wretched Parents all that night
Went shouting far and wide;
But there was neither sound nor sight
To serve them for a guide.

At day-break on a hill they stood
That overlook'd the Moor;
And thence they saw the Bridge of Wood
A furlong from their door.

And now they homeward turn'd, and cry'd
""In Heaven we all shall meet!""
When in the snow the Mother spied
The print of Lucy's feet.

Then downward from the steep hill's edge
They track'd the footmarks small;
And through the broken hawthorn-hedge,
And by the long stone-wall;

And then an open field they cross'd,
The marks were still the same;
They track'd them on, nor ever lost,
And to the Bridge they came.

They follow'd from the snowy bank
The footmarks, one by one,
Into the middle of the plank,
And further there were none.

Yet some maintain that to this day
She is a living Child,
That you may see sweet Lucy Gray
Upon the lonesome Wild.

O'er rough and smooth she trips along,
And never looks behind;
And sings a solitary song
That whistles in the wind."
36,Lucy poems pt 1 (Strange Fits of Passion Have I Known),"Strange fits of passion have I known:
And I will dare to tell,
But in the lover's ear alone,
What once to me befell.

When she I loved looked every day
Fresh as a rose in June,
I to her cottage bent my way,
Beneath an evening-moon.

Upon the moon I fixed my eye,
All over the wide lea;
With quickening pace my horse drew nigh
Those paths so dear to me.

And now we reached the orchard-plot;
And, as we climbed the hill,
The sinking moon to Lucy's cot
Came near, and nearer still.

In one of those sweet dreams I slept,
Kind Nature's gentlest boon!
And all the while my eye I kept
On the descending moon.

My horse moved on; hoof after hoof
He raised, and never stopped:
When down behind the cottage roof,
At once, the bright moon dropped.

What fond and wayward thoughts will slide
Into a Lover's head!
""O mercy!"" to myself I cried,
""If Lucy should be dead!"""
37,Lucy poems pt 4 (She Dwelt Among Untrodden Ways),"She dwelt among the untrodden ways
    Beside the springs of Dove,
Maid whom there were none to praise
    And very few to love:

A violet by a mossy stone
    Half hidden from the eye!
---Fair as a star, when only one
    Is shining in the sky.

She lived unknown, and few could know
    When Lucy ceased to be;
But she is in her grave, and, oh,
    The difference to me!"
38,Lucy poems pt 5 (A Slumber did my Spirit Seal),"A slumber did my spirit seal;
    I had no human fears:
She seemed a thing that could not feel
    The touch of earthly years.
No motion has she now, no force;
    She neither hears nor sees;
Rolled round in earth's diurnal course,
    With rocks, and stones, and trees."
39,Lucy poems pt2 (I Travelled among Unknown Men),"I travelled among unknown men,
       In lands beyond the sea;
Nor, England! did I know till then
       What love I bore to thee.

'Tis past, that melancholy dream!
       Nor will I quit thy shore
A second time; for still I seem
       To love thee more and more.

Among thy mountains did I feel
      The joy of my desire;
And she I cherished turned her wheel
      Beside an English fire.

Thy mornings showed, thy nights concealed,
      The bowers where Lucy played;
And thine too is the last green field
      That Lucy's eyes surveyed."
40,"Lucy poems pt3 (Three Years She Grew in Sun and Shower,)","Three years she grew in sun and shower,
Then Nature said, ""A lovelier flower
On earth was never sown;
This Child I to myself will take;
She shall be mine, and I will make
A Lady of my own.

""Myself will to my darling be
Both law and impulse: and with me
The Girl, in rock and plain
In earth and heaven, in glade and bower,
Shall feel an overseeing power
To kindle or restrain.

""She shall be sportive as the fawn
That wild with glee across the lawn
Or up the mountain springs;
And her's shall be the breathing balm,
And her's the silence and the calm
Of mute insensate things.

""The floating clouds their state shall lend
To her; for her the willow bend;
Nor shall she fail to see
Even in the motions of the Storm
Grace that shall mold the Maiden's form
By silent sympathy.

""The stars of midnight shall be dear
To her; and she shall lean her ear
In many a secret place
Where rivulets dance their wayward round,
And beauty born of murmuring sound
Shall pass into her face.

""And vital feelings of delight
Shall rear her form to stately height,
Her virgin bosom swell;
Such thoughts to Lucy I will give
While she and I together live
Here in this happy dell.""

Thus Nature spake---The work was done---
How soon my Lucy's race was run!
She died, and left to me
This heath, this calm, and quiet scene;
The memory of what has been,
And never more will be."
41,Memory,"A pen--to register; a key--
That winds through secret wards
Are well assigned to Memory
By allegoric Bards.

As aptly, also, might be given
A Pencil to her hand;
That, softening objects, sometimes even
Outstrips the heart's demand;

That smooths foregone distress, the lines
Of lingering care subdues,
Long-vanished happiness refines,
And clothes in brighter hues;

Yet, like a tool of Fancy, works
Those Spectres to dilate
That startle Conscience, as she lurks
Within her lonely seat.

Oh! that our lives, which flee so fast,
In purity were such,
That not an image of the past
Should fear that pencil's touch!

Retirement then might hourly look
Upon a soothing scene,
Age steal to his allotted nook
Contented and serene;

With heart as calm as lakes that sleep,
In frosty moonlight glistening;
Or mountain rivers, where they creep
Along a channel smooth and deep,
To their own far-off murmurs listening."
42,Michael: A Pastoral Poem,".  If from the public way you turn your steps
   Up the tumultuous brook of Green-head Ghyll,
   You will suppose that with an upright path
   Your feet must struggle; in such bold ascent
   The pastoral mountains front you, face to face.
   But, courage! for around that boisterous brook
   The mountains have all opened out themselves,
   And made a hidden valley of their own.
   No habitation can be seen; but they
  Who journey thither find themselves alone
  With a few sheep, with rocks and stones, and kites
  That overhead are sailing in the sky.
  It is in truth an utter solitude;
  Nor should I have made mention of this Dell
  But for one object which you might pass by,
  Might see and notice not. Beside the brook
  Appears a straggling heap of unhewn stones!
  And to that simple object appertains
  A story--unenriched with strange events,
  Yet not unfit, I deem, for the fireside,
  Or for the summer shade. It was the first
  Of those domestic tales that spake to me
  Of Shepherds, dwellers in the valleys, men
  Whom I already loved;--not verily
  For their own sakes, but for the fields and hills
  Where was their occupation and abode.
  And hence this Tale, while I was yet a Boy
  Careless of books, yet having felt the power
  Of Nature, by the gentle agency
  Of natural objects, led me on to feel
  For passions that were not my own, and think
  (At random and imperfectly indeed)
  On man, the heart of man, and human life.
  Therefore, although it be a history
  Homely and rude, I will relate the same
  For the delight of a few natural hearts;
  And, with yet fonder feeling, for the sake
  Of youthful Poets, who among these hills
  Will be my second self when I am gone.

      Upon the forest-side in Grasmere Vale
  There dwelt a Shepherd, Michael was his name;
  An old man, stout of heart, and strong of limb.
  His bodily frame had been from youth to age
  Of an unusual strength: his mind was keen,
  Intense, and frugal, apt for all affairs,
  And in his shepherd's calling he was prompt
  And watchful more than ordinary men.
  Hence had he learned the meaning of all winds,
  Of blasts of every tone; and oftentimes,
  When others heeded not, he heard the South
  Make subterraneous music, like the noise
  Of bagpipers on distant Highland hills.
  The Shepherd, at such warning, of his flock
  Bethought him, and he to himself would say,
  ""The winds are now devising work for me!""
  And, truly, at all times, the storm, that drives
  The traveller to a shelter, summoned him
  Up to the mountains: he had been alone
  Amid the heart of many thousand mists,
   That came to him, and left him, on the heights.
  So lived he till his eightieth year was past.
  And grossly that man errs, who should suppose
  That the green valleys, and the streams and rocks,
  Were things indifferent to the Shepherd's thoughts.
  Fields, where with cheerful spirits he had breathed
  The common air; hills, which with vigorous step
  He had so often climbed; which had impressed
  So many incidents upon his mind
  Of hardship, skill or courage, joy or fear;
  Which, like a book, preserved the memory
  Of the dumb animals, whom he had saved,
  Had fed or sheltered, linking to such acts
  The certainty of honourable gain;
  Those fields, those hills--what could they less? had laid
  Strong hold on his affections, were to him
  A pleasurable feeling of blind love,
  The pleasure which there is in life itself .

      His days had not been passed in singleness.
  His Helpmate was a comely matron, old--
  Though younger than himself full twenty years.
  She was a woman of a stirring life,
  Whose heart was in her house: two wheels she had
  Of antique form; this large, for spinning wool;
  That small, for flax; and, if one wheel had rest,
  It was because the other was at work.
  The Pair had but one inmate in their house,
  An only Child, who had been born to them
  When Michael, telling o'er his years, began
  To deem that he was old,--in shepherd's phrase,
  With one foot in the grave. This only Son,
  With two brave sheep-dogs tried in many a storm,
  The one of an inestimable worth,
  Made all their household. I may truly say,
  That they were as a proverb in the vale
  For endless industry. When day was gone,
  And from their occupations out of doors
  The Son and Father were come home, even then,
  Their labour did not cease; unless when all
  Turned to the cleanly supper-board, and there,
 Each with a mess of pottage and skimmed milk,
 Sat round the basket piled with oaten cakes,
 And their plain home-made cheese. Yet when the meal
 Was ended, Luke (for so the Son was named)
 And his old Father both betook themselves
 To such convenient work as might employ
 Their hands by the fireside; perhaps to card
 Wool for the Housewife's spindle, or repair
 Some injury done to sickle, flail, or scythe,
 Or other implement of house or field.


    Down from the ceiling, by the chimney's edge,
 That in our ancient uncouth country style
 With huge and black projection overbrowed
 Large space beneath, as duly as the light
 Of day grew dim the Housewife hung a lamp,
 An aged utensil, which had performed
 Service beyond all others of its kind.
 Early at evening did it burn--and late,
 Surviving comrade of uncounted hours,
 Which, going by from year to year, had found,
 And left the couple neither gay perhaps
 Nor cheerful, yet with objects and with hopes,
 Living a life of eager industry.
 And now, when Luke had reached his eighteenth year,
 There by the light of this old lamp they sate,
 Father and Son, while far into the night
 The Housewife plied her own peculiar work,
 Making the cottage through the silent hours
 Murmur as with the sound of summer flies.
 This light was famous in its neighbourhood,
 And was a public symbol of the life
 That thrifty Pair had lived. For, as it chanced,
 Their cottage on a plot of rising ground
 Stood single, with large prospect, north and south,
 High into Easedale, up to Dunmail-Raise,
 And westward to the village near the lake;
 And from this constant light, so regular
 And so far seen, the House itself, by all
 Who dwelt within the limits of the vale,
 Both old and young, was named The Evening Star.


    Thus living on through such a length of years,
 The Shepherd, if he loved himself, must needs
 Have loved his Helpmate; but to Michael's heart
 This son of his old age was yet more dear--
 Less from instinctive tenderness, the same
 Fond spirit that blindly works in the blood of all--
 Than that a child, more than all other gifts
 That earth can offer to declining man,
 Brings hope with it, and forward-looking thoughts,
 And stirrings of inquietude, when they
 By tendency of nature needs must fail.
 Exceeding was the love he bare to him,
 His heart and his heart's joy! For oftentimes
 Old Michael, while he was a babe in arms,
 Had done him female service, not alone
 For pastime and delight, as is the use
 Of fathers, but with patient mind enforced
 To acts of tenderness; and he had rocked
 His cradle, as with a woman's gentle hand.


    And, in a later time, ere yet the Boy
 Had put on boy's attire, did Michael love,
 Albeit of a stern unbending mind,
 To have the Young-one in his sight, when he
 Wrought in the field, or on his shepherd's stool
 Sate with a fettered sheep before him stretched
 Under the large old oak, that near his door
 Stood single, and, from matchless depth of shade,
 Chosen for the Shearer's covert from the sun,
 Thence in our rustic dialect was called
 The Clipping Tree, a name which yet it bears.
 There, while they two were sitting in the shade,
 With others round them, earnest all and blithe,
 Would Michael exercise his heart with looks
 Of fond correction and reproof bestowed
 Upon the Child, if he disturbed the sheep
 By catching at their legs, or with his shouts
 Scared them, while they lay still beneath the shears.


    And when by Heaven's good grace the boy grew up
 A healthy Lad, and carried in his cheek
 Two steady roses that were five years old;
 Then Michael from a winter coppice cut
 With his own hand a sapling, which he hooped
 With iron, making it throughout in all
 Due requisites a perfect shepherd's staff,
 And gave it to the Boy; wherewith equipt
 He as a watchman oftentimes was placed
 At gate or gap, to stem or turn the flock;
 And, to his office prematurely called,
 There stood the urchin, as you will divine,
 Something between a hindrance and a help,
 And for this cause not always, I believe,
 Receiving from his Father hire of praise;
 Though nought was left undone which staff, or voice,
 Or looks, or threatening gestures, could perform.


    But soon as Luke, full ten years old, could stand
 Against the mountain blasts; and to the heights,
 Not fearing toil, nor length of weary ways,
 He with his Father daily went, and they
 Were as companions, why should I relate
 That objects which the Shepherd loved before
 Were dearer now? that from the Boy there came
 Feelings and emanations--things which were
 Light to the sun and music to the wind;
 And that the old Man's heart seemed born again?


    Thus in his Father's sight the Boy grew up:
 And now, when he had reached his eighteenth year,
 He was his comfort and his daily hope.


    While in this sort the simple household lived
 From day to day, to Michael's ear there came
 Distressful tidings. Long before the time
 Of which I speak, the Shepherd had been bound
 In surety for his brother's son, a man
 Of an industrious life, and ample means;
 But unforeseen misfortunes suddenly
 Had prest upon him; and old Michael now
 Was summoned to discharge the forfeiture,
 A grievous penalty, but little less
 Than half his substance. This unlooked-for claim
 At the first hearing, for a moment took
 More hope out of his life than he supposed
 That any old man ever could have lost.
 As soon as he had armed himself with strength
 To look his trouble in the face, it seemed
 The Shepherd's sole resource to sell at once
 A portion of his patrimonial fields.
 Such was his first resolve; he thought again,
 And his heart failed him. ""Isabel,"" said he,
 Two evenings after he had heard the news,
 ""I have been toiling more than seventy years,
 And in the open sunshine of God's love
 Have we all lived; yet, if these fields of ours
 Should pass into a stranger's hand, I think
 That I could not lie quiet in my grave.
 Our lot is a hard lot; the sun himself
 Has scarcely been more diligent than I;
 And I have lived to be a fool at last
 To my own family. An evil man
 That was, and made an evil choice, if he
 Were false to us; and, if he were not false,
 There are ten thousand to whom loss like this
 Had been no sorrow. I forgive him;--but
 'Twere better to be dumb than to talk thus.


    ""When I began, my purpose was to speak
 Of remedies and of a cheerful hope.
 Our Luke shall leave us, Isabel; the land
 Shall not go from us, and it shall be free;
 He shall possess it, free as is the wind
 That passes over it. We have, thou know'st,
 Another kinsman--he will be our friend
 In this distress. He is a prosperous man,
 Thriving in trade and Luke to him shall go,
 And with his kinsman's help and his own thrift
 He quickly will repair this loss, and then
 He may return to us. If here he stay,
 What can be done? Where every one is poor,
 What can be gained?""       At this the old Man paused,
 And Isabel sat silent, for her mind
 Was busy, looking back into past times.
 There's Richard Bateman, thought she to herself,
 He was a parish-boy--at the church-door
 They made a gathering for him, shillings, pence,
 And halfpennies, wherewith the neighbours bought
 A basket, which they filled with pedlar's wares;
 And, with this basket on his arm, the lad
 Went up to London, found a master there,
 Who, out of many, chose the trusty boy
 To go and overlook his merchandise
 Beyond the seas; where he grew wondrous rich,
 And left estates and monies to the poor,
 And, at his birth-place, built a chapel floored
 With marble, which he sent from foreign lands.
 These thoughts, and many others of like sort,
 Passed quickly through the mind of Isabel,
 And her face brightened. The old Man was glad,
 And thus resumed:--""Well, Isabel! this scheme
 These two days has been meat and drink to me.
 Far more than we have lost is left us yet.
 --We have enough--I wish indeed that I
 Were younger;--but this hope is a good hope.
 Make ready Luke's best garments, of the best
 Buy for him more, and let us send him forth
 To-morrow, or the next day, or to-night:
 --If he  could go, the boy should go to-night.""


    Here Michael ceased, and to the fields went forth
 With a light heart. The Housewife for five days
 Was restless morn and night, and all day long
 Wrought on with her best fingers to prepare.
 Things needful for the journey of her Son.
 But Isabel was glad when Sunday came
 To stop her in her work: for, when she lay
 By Michael's side, she through the last two nights
 Heard him, how he was troubled in his sleep:
 And when they rose at morning she could see
 That all his hopes were gone. That day at noon
 She said to Luke, while they two by themselves
 Were sitting at the door, ""Thou must not go:
 We have no other Child but thee to lose,
 None to remember--do not go away,
 For if thou leave thy Father he will die.""
 The Youth made answer with a jocund voice;
 And Isabel, when she had told her fears,
 Recovered heart. That evening her best fare
 Did she bring forth, and all together sat
 Like happy people round a Christmas fire.


    With daylight Isabel resumed her work;
 And all the ensuing week the house appeared
 As cheerful as a grove in Spring: at length
 The expected letter from their kinsman came,
 With kind assurances that he would do
 His utmost for the welfare of the Boy;
 To which requests were added, that forthwith
 He might be sent to him. Ten times or more
 The letter was read over, Isabel
 Went forth to show it to the neighbours round;
 Nor was there at that time on English land
 A prouder heart than Luke's. When Isabel
 Had to her house returned, the old man said,
 ""He shall depart to-morrow."" To this word
 The Housewife answered, talking much of things
 Which, if at such short notice he should go,
 Would surely be forgotten. But at length
 She gave consent, and Michael was at ease.


    Near the tumultuous brook of Green-head Ghyll,
 In that deep valley, Michael had designed
 To build a Sheep-fold; and, before he heard
 The tidings of his melancholy loss,
 For this same purpose he had gathered up
 A heap of stones, which by the streamlet's edge
 Lay thrown together, ready for the work.
 With Luke that evening thitherward he walked:
 And soon as they had reached the place he stopped,
 And thus the old Man spake to him:--""My Son,
 To-morrow thou wilt leave me: with full heart
 I look upon thee, for thou art the same
 That wert a promise to me ere thy birth,
 And all thy life hast been my daily joy.
 I will relate to thee some little part
 Of our two histories; 'twill do thee good
 When thou art from me, even if I should touch
 On things thou canst not know of.--After thou
 First cam'st into the world--as oft befalls
 To new-born infants--thou didst sleep away
 Two days, and blessings from thy Father's tongue
 Then fell upon thee. Day by day passed on,
 And still I loved thee with increasing love.
 Never to living ear came sweeter sounds
 Than when I heard thee by our own fireside
 First uttering, without words, a natural tune;
 While thou, a feeding babe, didst in thy joy
 Sing at thy Mother's breast. Month followed month,
 And in the open fields my life was passed,
 And on the mountains; else I think that thou
 Hadst been brought up upon thy Father's knees.
 But we were playmates, Luke: among these hills,
 As well thou knowest, in us the old and young
 Have played together, nor with me didst thou
 Lack any pleasure which a boy can know.""
 Luke had a manly heart; but at these words
 He sobbed aloud. The old Man grasped his hand,
 And said, ""Nay, do not take it so--I see
 That these are things of which I need not speak.
 --Even to the utmost I have been to thee
 A kind and a good Father: and herein
 I but repay a gift which I myself
 Received at others' hands; for, though now old
 Beyond the common life of man, I still
 Remember them who loved me in my youth.
 Both of them sleep together: here they lived,
 As all their Forefathers had done; and, when
 At length their time was come, they were not loth
 To give their bodies to the family mould.
 I wished that thou should'st live the life they lived:
 But, 'tis a long time to look back, my Son,
 And see so little gain from threescore years.
 These fields were burthened when they came to me;
 Till I was forty years of age, not more
 Than half of my inheritance was mine.
 I toiled and toiled; God blessed me in my work,
 And till these three weeks past the land was free.
 --It looks as if it never could endure
 Another Master. Heaven forgive me, Luke,
 If I judge ill for thee, but it seems good
 That thou should'st go.""       At this the old Man paused;
 Then, pointing to the stones near which they stood,
 Thus, after a short silence, he resumed:
 ""This was a work for us; and now, my Son,
 It is a work for me. But, lay one stone--
 Here, lay it for me, Luke, with thine own hands.
 Nay, Boy, be of good hope;--we both may live
 To see a better day. At eighty-four
 I still am strong and hale;--do thou thy part;
 I will do mine.--I will begin again
 With many tasks that were resigned to thee:
 Up to the heights, and in among the storms,
 Will I without thee go again, and do
 All works which I was wont to do alone,
 Before I knew thy face.--Heaven bless thee, Boy!
 Thy heart these two weeks has been beating fast
 With many hopes; it should be so--yes--yes--
 I knew that thou could'st never have a wish
 To leave me, Luke: thou hast been bound to me
 Only by links of love: when thou art gone,
 What will be left to us!--But, I forget
 My purposes. Lay now the corner-stone,
 As I requested; and hereafter, Luke,
 When thou art gone away, should evil men
 Be thy companions, think of me, my Son,
 And of this moment; hither turn thy thoughts,
 And God will strengthen thee: amid all fear
 And all temptation, Luke, I pray that thou
 May'st bear in mind the life thy Fathers lived,
 Who, being innocent, did for that cause
 Bestir them in good deeds. Now, fare thee well--
 When thou return'st, thou in this place wilt see
 A work which is not here: a covenant
 'Twill be between us; but, whatever fate
 Befall thee, I shall love thee to the last,
 And bear thy memory with me to the grave.""


    The Shepherd ended here; and Luke stooped down,
 And, as his Father had requested, laid
 The first stone of the Sheep-fold. At the sight
 The old Man's grief broke from him; to his heart
 He pressed his Son, he kissed him and wept;
 And to the house together they returned.
 --Hushed was that House in peace, or seeming peace,
 Ere the night fell:--with morrow's dawn the Boy
 Began his journey, and, when he had reached
 The public way, he put on a bold face;
 And all the neighbours, as he passed their doors,
 Came forth with wishes and with farewell prayers,
 That followed him till he was out of sight.
 A good report did from their Kinsman come,
 Of Luke and his well-doing; and the Boy
 Wrote loving letters, full of wondrous news,
 Which, as the Housewife phrased it, were throughout
 ""The prettiest letters that were ever seen.""
 Both parents read them with rejoicing hearts.
 So, many months passed on: and once again
 The Shepherd went about his daily work
 With confident and cheerful thoughts; and now
 Sometimes when he could find a leisure hour
 He to that valley took his way, and there
 Wrought at the Sheep-fold. Meantime Luke began
 To slacken in his duty; and, at length,
 He in the dissolute city gave himself
 To evil courses: ignominy and shame
 Fell on him, so that he was driven at last
 To seek a hiding-place beyond the seas.


    There is a comfort in the strength of love;
 'Twill make a thing endurable, which else
 Would overset the brain, or break the heart:
 I have conversed with more than one who well
 Remember the old Man, and what he was
 Years after he had heard this heavy news.
 His bodily frame had been from youth to age
 Of an unusual strength. Among the rocks
 He went, and still looked up to sun and cloud,
 And listened to the wind; and, as before,
 Performed all kinds of labour for his sheep,
 And for the land, his small inheritance.
 And to that hollow dell from time to time
 Did he repair, to build the Fold of which
 His flock had need. 'Tis not forgotten yet
 The pity which was then in every heart
 For the old Man--and 'tis believed by all
 That many and many a day he thither went,
 And never lifted up a single stone.


    There, by the Sheep-fold, sometimes was he seen
 Sitting alone, or with his faithful Dog,
 Then old, beside him, lying at his feet.
 The length of full seven years, from time to time,
 He at the building of this Sheep-fold wrought,
 And left the work unfinished when he died.
 Three years, or little more, did Isabel
 Survive her Husband: at her death the estate
 Was sold, and went into a stranger's hand.
 The Cottage which was named The Evening Star
 Is gone--the ploughshare has been through the ground
 On which it stood; great changes have been wrought
 In all the neighbourhood:--yet the oak is left
 That grew beside their door; and the remains
 Of the unfinished Sheep-fold may be seen
 Beside the boisterous brook of Green-head Ghyll."
43,Most Sweet it is,".  Most sweet it is with unuplifted eyes
   To pace the ground, if path be there or none,
   While a fair region round the traveller lies
   Which he forbears again to look upon;
   Pleased rather with some soft ideal scene,
   The work of Fancy, or some happy tone
   Of meditation, slipping in between
   The beauty coming and the beauty gone.
   If Thought and Love desert us, from that day
  Let us break off all commerce with the Muse:
  With Thought and Love companions of our way,
  Whate'er the senses take or may refuse,
  The Mind's internal heaven shall shed her dews
  Of inspiration on the humblest lay."
44,Mutability,".    From low to high doth dissolution climb,
   And sink from high to low, along a scale
   Of awful notes, whose concord shall not fail;
   A musical but melancholy chime,
   Which they can hear who meddle not with crime,
   Nor avarice, nor over-anxious care.
   Truth fails not; but her outward forms that bear
   The longest date do melt like frosty rime,
   That in the morning whitened hill and plain
  And is no more; drop like the tower sublime
  Of yesterday, which royally did wear
  His crown of weeds, but could not even sustain
  Some casual shout that broke the silent air,
  Or the unimaginable touch of Time."
45,"November, 1806",".   Another year!--another deadly blow!
   Another mighty Empire overthrown!
   And We are left, or shall be left, alone;
   The last that dare to struggle with the Foe.
   'Tis well! from this day forward we shall know
   That in ourselves our safety must be sought;
   That by our own right hands it must be wrought;
   That we must stand unpropped, or be laid low.
   O dastard whom such foretaste doth not cheer!
  We shall exult, if they who rule the land
  Be men who hold its many blessings dear,
  Wise, upright, valiant; not a servile band,
  Who are to judge of danger which they fear,
  And honour which they do not understand."
46,Nuns Fret Not at Their Convent's Narrow Room,"Nuns fret not at their convent's narrow room;
And hermits are contented with their cells;
And students with their pensive citadels;
Maids at the wheel, the weaver at his loom,
Sit blithe and happy; bees that soar for bloom,
High as the highest Peak of Furness-fells,
Will murmur by the hour in foxglove bells:
In truth the prison, unto which we doom
Ourselves, no prison is: and hence for me,
In sundry moods, 'twas pastime to be bound
Within the Sonnet's scanty plot of ground;
Pleased if some Souls (for such there needs must be)
Who have felt the weight of too much liberty,
Should find brief solace there, as I have found."
47,Nutting,".         --It seems a day
   (I speak of one from many singled out)
   One of those heavenly days that cannot die;
   When, in the eagerness of boyish hope,
   I left our cottage-threshold, sallying forth
   With a huge wallet o'er my shoulders slung,
   A nutting-crook in hand; and turned my steps
   Tow'rd some far-distant wood, a Figure quaint,
   Tricked out in proud disguise of cast-off weeds
  Which for that service had been husbanded,
  By exhortation of my frugal Dame--
  Motley accoutrement, of power to smile
  At thorns, and brakes, and brambles,--and, in truth,
  More ragged than need was! O'er pathless rocks,
  Through beds of matted fern, and tangled thickets,
  Forcing my way, I came to one dear nook
  Unvisited, where not a broken bough
  Drooped with its withered leaves, ungracious sign
  Of devastation; but the hazels rose
  Tall and erect, with tempting clusters hung,
  A virgin scene!--A little while I stood,
  Breathing with such suppression of the heart
  As joy delights in; and, with wise restraint
  Voluptuous, fearless of a rival, eyed
  The banquet;--or beneath the trees I sate
  Among the flowers, and with the flowers I played;
  A temper known to those, who, after long
  And weary expectation, have been blest
  With sudden happiness beyond all hope.
  Perhaps it was a bower beneath whose leaves
  The violets of five seasons re-appear
  And fade, unseen by any human eye;
  Where fairy water-breaks do murmur on
  For ever; and I saw the sparkling foam,
  And--with my cheek on one of those green stones
  That, fleeced with moss, under the shady trees,
  Lay round me, scattered like a flock of sheep--
  I heard the murmur, and the murmuring sound,
  In that sweet mood when pleasure loves to pay
  Tribute to ease; and, of its joy secure,
  The heart luxuriates with indifferent things,
  Wasting its kindliness on stocks and stones,
  And on the vacant air. Then up I rose,
  And dragged to earth both branch and bough, with crash
  And merciless ravage: and the shady nook
  Of hazels, and the green and mossy bower,
  Deformed and sullied, patiently gave up
  Their quiet being: and, unless I now
  Confound my present feelings with the past;
  Ere from the mutilated bower I turned
  Exulting, rich beyond the wealth of kings,
  I felt a sense of pain when I beheld
  The silent trees, and saw the intruding sky.--
  Then, dearest Maiden, move along these shades
  In gentleness of heart; with gentle hand
  Touch--for there is a spirit in the woods."
48,O Nightingale! Thou Surely Art,"O Nightingale! thou surely art
A creature of a ""fiery heart"":--
These notes of thine--they pierce and pierce;
Tumultuous harmony and fierce!
Thou sing'st as if the God of wine
Had helped thee to a Valentine;
A song in mockery and despite
Of shades, and dews, and silent night;
And steady bliss, and all the loves
Now sleeping in these peaceful groves.
I heard a Stock-dove sing or say
His homely tale, this very day;
His voice was buried among trees,
Yet to be come at by the breeze:
He did not cease; but cooed--and cooed;
And somewhat pensively he wooed:
He sang of love, with quiet blending,
Slow to begin, and never ending;
Of serious faith, and inward glee;
That was the song -- the song for me!"
49,"October, 1803",".  These times strike monied worldlings with dismay:
  Even rich men, brave by nature, taint the air
  With words of apprehension and despair:
  While tens of thousands, thinking on the affray,
  Men unto whom sufficient for the day
  And minds not stinted or untilled are given,
  Sound, healthy, children of the God of heaven,
  Are cheerful as the rising sun in May.
  What do we gather hence but firmer faith
 That every gift of noble origin
 Is breathed upon by Hope's perpetual breath;
 That virtue and the faculties within
 Are vital,--and that riches are akin
 To fear, to change, to cowardice, and death?"
50,Ode Composed On A May Morning,"WHILE from the purpling east departs
    The star that led the dawn,
Blithe Flora from her couch upstarts,
    For May is on the lawn.
A quickening hope, a freshening glee,
    Foreran the expected Power,
Whose first-drawn breath, from bush and tree,
    Shakes off that pearly shower.

All Nature welcomes Her whose sway
    Tempers the year's extremes;
Who scattereth lustres o'er noon-day,
    Like morning's dewy gleams;
While mellow warble, sprightly trill,
    The tremulous heart excite;
And hums the balmy air to still
    The balance of delight.

Time was, blest Power! when youth and maids
    At peep of dawn would rise,
And wander forth, in forest glades
    Thy birth to solemnize.
Though mute the song---to grace the rite
    Untouched the hawthorn bough,
Thy Spirit triumphs o'er the slight;
    Man changes, but not Thou!

Thy feathered Lieges bill and wings
    In love's disport employ;
Warmed by thy influence, creeping things
    Awake to silent joy:
Queen art thou still for each gay plant
    Where the slim wild deer roves;
And served in depths where fishes haunt
    Their own mysterious groves.

Cloud-piercing peak, and trackless heath,
    Instinctive homage pay;
Nor wants the dim-lit cave a wreath
    To honor thee, sweet May!
Where cities fanned by thy brisk airs
    Behold a smokeless sky,
Their puniest flower-pot-nursling dares
    To open a bright eye.

And if, on this thy natal morn,
    The pole, from which thy name
Hath not departed, stands forlorn
    Of song and dance and game;
Still from the village-green a vow
    Aspires to thee addrest,
Wherever peace is on the brow,
    Or love within the breast.

Yes! where Love nestles thou canst teach
    The soul to love the more;
Hearts also shall thy lessons reach
    That never loved before.
Stript is the haughty one of pride,
    The bashful freed from fear,
While rising, like the ocean-tide,
    In flow the joyous year.

Hush, feeble lyre! weak words refuse
    The service to prolong!
To yon exulting thrush the Muse
    Entrusts the imperfect song;
His voice shall chant, in accents clear,
    Throughout the live-long day,
Till the first silver star appear,
    The sovereignty of May."
51,Ode On Intimations Of Immortality,"From Recollections of Early Childhood

The Child is father of the Man;
And I could wish my days to be
 Bound each to each by natural piety.


                    I

There was a time when meadow, grove, and stream,
The earth, and every common sight,
        To me did seem
      Apparelled in celestial light,
The glory and the freshness of a dream.
It is not now as it hath been of yore;--
      Turn wheresoe'er I may,
        By night or day,
The things which I have seen I now can see no more.


                    II

    The Rainbow comes and goes,
    And lovely is the Rose,
    The Moon doth with delight
  Look round her when the heavens are bare;
    Waters on a starry night
    Are beautiful and fair;
  The sunshine is a glorious birth;
  But yet I know, where'er I go,
That there hath past away a glory from the earth.


                    III

Now, while the birds thus sing a joyous song,
  And while the young lambs bound
    As to the tabor's sound,
To me alone there came a thought of grief:
A timely utterance gave that thought relief,
    And I again am strong:
The cataracts blow their trumpets from the steep;
No more shall grief of mine the season wrong;
I hear the Echoes through the mountains throng,
The Winds come to me from the fields of sleep,
    And all the earth is gay;
        Land and sea
  Give themselves up to jollity,
    And with the heart of May
  Doth every Beast keep holiday;--
    Thou Child of Joy,
Shout round me, let me hear thy shouts, thou happy Shepherd-boy!


                    IV

Ye blesse`d Creatures, I have heard the call
  Ye to each other make; I see
The heavens laugh with you in your jubilee;
  My heart is at your festival,
    My head hath its coronal,
The fulness of your bliss, I feel--I feel it all.
    Oh evil day! if I were sullen
    While the Earth herself is adorning,
      This sweet May-morning,
    And the Children are culling
      On every side,
    In a thousand valleys far and wide,
    Fresh flowers; while the sun shines warm,
And the Babe leaps up on his Mother's arm:--
    I hear, I hear, with joy I hear!
    --But there's a Tree, of many, one,
A single Field which I have looked upon,
Both of them speak of something that is gone:
      The Pansy at my feet
      Doth the same tale repeat:
Whither is fled the visionary gleam?
Where is it now, the glory and the dream?


                    V

Our birth is but a sleep and a forgetting:
The Soul that rises with us, our life's Star,
    Hath had elsewhere its setting,
      And cometh from afar:
    Not in entire forgetfulness,
    And not in utter nakedness,
But trailing clouds of glory do we come
    From God, who is our home:
Heaven lies about us in our infancy!
Shades of the prison-house begin to close
    Upon the growing Boy,
But He beholds the light, and whence it flows,
    He sees it in his joy;
The Youth, who daily farther from the east
    Must travel, still is Nature's Priest,
    And by the vision splendid
    Is on his way attended;
At length the Man perceives it die away,
And fade into the light of common day.


                    VI

Earth fills her lap with pleasures of her own;
Yearnings she hath in her own natural kind,
And, even with something of a Mother's mind,
    And no unworthy aim,
    The homely Nurse doth all she can
To make her Foster-child, her Inmate Man,
    Forget the glories he hath known,
And that imperial palace whence he came.


                    VII

Behold the Child among his new-born blisses,
A six years' Darling of a pigmy size!
See, where 'mid work of his own hand he lies,
Fretted by sallies of his mother's kisses,
With light upon him from his father's eyes!
See, at his feet, some little plan or chart,
Some fragment from his dream of human life,
Shaped by himself with newly-learned art;
  A wedding or a festival,
  A mourning or a funeral;
    And this hath now his heart,
  And unto this he frames his song:
    Then will he fit his tongue
To dialogues of business, love, or strife;
    But it will not be long
    Ere this be thrown aside,
  And with new joy and pride
The little Actor cons another part;
Filling from time to time his ""humorous stage""
With all the Persons, down to palsied Age,
That Life brings with her in her equipage;
    As if his whole vocation
    Were endless imitation.


                    VIII

Thou, whose exterior semblance doth belie
    Thy Soul's immensity;
Thou best Philosopher, who yet dost keep
Thy heritage, thou Eye among the blind,
That, deaf and silent, read'st the eternal deep,
Haunted for ever by the eternal mind,--
    Might Prophet! Seer blest!
    On whom those truths do rest,
Which we are toiling all our lives to find,
In darkness lost, the darkness of the grave;
Thou, over whom thy Immortality
Broods like the Day, a Master o'er a Slave,
A Presence which is not to be put by;
      [To whom the grave
Is but a lonely bed without the sense or sight
    Of day or the warm light,
A place of thought where we in waiting lie;]
Thou little Child, yet glorious in the might
Of heaven-born freedom on thy being's height,
Why with such earnest pains dost thou provoke
The years to bring the inevitable yoke,
Thus blindly with thy blessedness at strife?
Full soon thy Soul shall have her earthly freight,
And custom lie upon thee with a weight,
Heavy as frost, and deep almost as life!


                    IX

    O joy! that in our embers
    Is something that doth live,
    That nature yet remembers
    What was so fugitive!
The thought of our past years in me doth breed
Perpetual benediction: not indeed
For that which is most worthy to be blest;
Delight and liberty, the simple creed
Of Childhood, whether busy or at rest,
With new-fledged hope still fluttering in his breast:--
    Not for these I raise
    The song of thanks and praise;
  But for those obstinate questionings
  Of sense and outward things,
  Fallings from us, vanishings;
  Blank misgivings of a Creature
Moving about in worlds not realised,
High instincts before which our mortal Nature
Did tremble like a guilty Thing surprised:
    But for those first affections,
    Those shadowy recollections,
  Which, be they what they may,
Are yet the fountain-light of all our day,
Are yet a master-light of all our seeing;
  Uphold us, cherish, and have power to make
Our noisy years seem moments in the being
Of the eternal Silence: truths that wake,
      To perish never;
Which neither listlessness, nor mad endeavor,
      Nor Man nor Boy,
Nor all that is at enmity with joy,
Can utterly abolish or destroy!
  Hence in a season of calm weather
    Though inland far we be,
Our Souls have sight of that immortal sea
    Which brought us hither,
  Can in a moment travel thither,
And see the Children sport upon the shore,
And hear the mighty waters rolling evermore.


                    X

Then sing, ye Birds, sing, sing a joyous song!
    And yet the young Lambs bound
    As to the tabor's sound!
We in thought will join your throng,
    Ye that pipe and ye that play,
    Ye that through your hearts to-day
    Feel the gladness of the May!
What though the radiance which was once so bright
Be now for ever taken from my sight,
  Though nothing can bring back the hour
Of splendour in the grass, of glory in the flower;
    We will grieve not, rather find
    Strength in what remains behind;
    In the primal sympathy
    Which having been must ever be;
    In the soothing thoughts that spring
    Out of human suffering;
    In the faith that looks through death,
In years that bring the philosophic mind.


                    XI

And O, ye Fountains, Meadows, Hills, and Groves,
Forebode not any severing of our loves!
Yet in my heart of hearts I feel your might;
I only have relinquished one delight
To live beneath your more habitual sway.
I love the Brooks which down their channels fret,
Even more than when I tripped lightly as they;
The innocent brightness of a new-born Day
      Is lovely yet;
The Clouds that gather round the setting sun
Do take a sober colouring from an eye
That hath kept watch o'er man's mortality;
Another race hath been, and other palms are won.
Thanks to the human heart by which we live,
Thanks to its tenderness, its joys, and fears,
To me the meanest flower that blows can give
Thoughts that do often lie too deep for tears."
52,Ode to Duty,". Stern Daughter of the Voice of God!
   O Duty! if that name thou love
   Who art a light to guide, a rod
   To check the erring, and reprove;
   Thou, who art victory and law
   When empty terrors overawe;
   From vain temptations dost set free;
   And calm'st the weary strife of frail humanity!
   There are who ask not if thine eye
  Be on them; who, in love and truth,
  Where no misgiving is, rely
  Upon the genial sense of youth:
  Glad Hearts! without reproach or blot;
  Who do thy work, and know it not:
  Oh! if through confidence misplaced
  They fail, thy saving arms, dread Power! around them cast.

  Serene will be our days and bright,
  And happy will our nature be,
  When love is an unerring light,
  And joy its own security.
  And they a blissful course may hold
  Even now, who, not unwisely bold,
  Live in the spirit of this creed;
  Yet seek thy firm support, according to their need.

  I, loving freedom, and untried;
  No sport of every random gust,
  Yet being to myself a guide,
  Too blindly have reposed my trust:
  And oft, when in my heart was heard
  Thy timely mandate, I deferred
  The task, in smoother walks to stray;
  But thee I now would serve more strictly, if I may.

  Through no disturbance of my soul,
  Or strong compunction in me wrought,
  I supplicate for thy control;
  But in the quietness of thought:
  Me this unchartered freedom tires;
  I feel the weight of chance-desires:
  My hopes no more must change their name,
  I long for a repose that ever is the same.

  Stern Lawgiver! yet thou dost wear
  The Godhead's most benignant grace;
  Nor know we anything so fair
  As is the smile upon thy face:
  Flowers laugh before thee on their beds
  And fragrance in thy footing treads;
  Thou dost preserve the stars from wrong;
  And the most ancient heavens, through Thee, are fresh and strong.

  To humbler functions, awful Power!
  I call thee: I myself commend
  Unto thy guidance from this hour;
  Oh, let my weakness have an end!
  Give unto me, made lowly wise,
  The spirit of self-sacrifice;
  The confidence of reason give;
  And in the light of truth thy Bondman let me live!"
53,Ode: Intimations of Immortality,"I

         There was a time when meadow, grove, and stream,
         The earth, and every common sight,
                   To me did seem
                 Apparelled in celestial light,
         The glory and the freshness of a dream.
         It is not now as it hath been of yore;--
                 Turn wheresoe'er I may,
                   By night or day,
         The things which I have seen I now can see no more.


                                  II

                 The Rainbow comes and goes,
                 And lovely is the Rose,
                 The Moon doth with delight
           Look round her when the heavens are bare,
                 Waters on a starry night
                 Are beautiful and fair;
             The sunshine is a glorious birth;
             But yet I know, where'er I go,
         That there hath past away a glory from the earth.

         Now, while the birds thus sing a joyous song,
             And while the young lambs bound
                 As to the tabor's sound,
         To me alone there came a thought of grief:
         A timely utterance gave that thought relief,
                 And I again am strong:
         The cataracts blow their trumpets from the steep;
         No more shall grief of mine the season wrong;
         I hear the Echoes through the mountains throng,
         The Winds come to me from the fields of sleep,
                 And all the earth is gay;
                     Land and sea
             Give themselves up to jollity,
                 And with the heart of May
             Doth every Beast keep holiday;--
                 Thou Child of Joy,
         Shout round me, let me hear thy shouts, thou happy
                   Shepherd-boy!

         Ye blessed Creatures, I have heard the call
             Ye to each other make; I see
         The heavens laugh with you in your jubilee;
             My heart is at your festival,
             My head hath its coronal,
         The fulness of your bliss, I feel--I feel it all.
             Oh evil day! if I were sullen
             While Earth herself is adorning,
                 This sweet May-morning,
             And the Children are culling
                 On every side,
             In a thousand valleys far and wide,
             Fresh flowers; while the sun shines warm,
         And the Babe leaps up on his Mother's arm:--
             I hear, I hear, with joy I hear!
             --But there's a Tree, of many, one,
         A single Field which I have looked upon,
         Both of them speak of something that is gone:
             The Pansy at my feet
             Doth the same tale repeat:
         Whither is fled the visionary gleam?
         Where is it now, the glory and the dream?


                                  V

         Our birth is but a sleep and a forgetting:
         The Soul that rises with us, our life's Star,
             Hath had elsewhere its setting,
               And cometh from afar:
             Not in entire forgetfulness,
             And not in utter nakedness,
         But trailing clouds of glory do we come
             From God, who is our home:
         Heaven lies about us in our infancy!
         Shades of the prison-house begin to close
             Upon the growing Boy,
         But He beholds the light, and whence it flows,
             He sees it in his joy;
         The Youth, who daily farther from the east
             Must travel, still is Nature's Priest,
             And by the vision splendid
             Is on his way attended;
         At length the Man perceives it die away,
         And fade into the light of common day.

         Earth fills her lap with pleasures of her own;
         Yearnings she hath in her own natural kind,
         And, even with something of a Mother's mind,
             And no unworthy aim,
             The homely Nurse doth all she can
         To make her Foster-child, her Inmate Man,
             Forget the glories he hath known,
         And that imperial palace whence he came.

         Behold the Child among his new-born blisses,
         A six years' Darling of a pigmy size!
         See, where 'mid work of his own hand he lies,
         Fretted by sallies of his mother's kisses,
         With light upon him from his father's eyes!
         See, at his feet, some little plan or chart,
         Some fragment from his dream of human life,
         Shaped by himself with newly-learned art;
             A wedding or a festival,
             A mourning or a funeral;
                 And this hath now his heart,
             And unto this he frames his song:
                 Then will he fit his tongue
         To dialogues of business, love, or strife;
             But it will not be long
             Ere this be thrown aside,
             And with new joy and pride
         The little Actor cons another part;
         Filling from time to time his ""humorous stage""
         With all the Persons, down to palsied Age,
         That Life brings with her in her equipage;
             As if his whole vocation
             Were endless imitation.

         Thou, whose exterior semblance doth belie
             Thy Soul's immensity;

         Thy heritage, thou Eye among the blind,
         That, deaf and silent, read'st the eternal deep,
         Haunted for ever by the eternal mind,--

         In darkness lost, the darkness of the grave;
         Thou, over whom thy Immortality
         Broods like the Day, a Master o'er a Slave,
         A Presence which is not to be put by;
         Thou little Child, yet glorious in the might

         Heavy as frost, and deep almost as life!

             That nature yet remembers

         Can utterly abolish or destroy!
             Hence in a season of calm weather
             Though inland far we be,
         Our Souls have sight of that immortal sea

         Thoughts that do often lie too deep for tears."
54,Of a Forsaken Indian Woman,"Before I see another day,
Oh let my body die away!
In sleep I heard the northern gleams;
The stars, they were among my dreams;
In rustling conflict through the skies,
I heard, I saw the flashes drive,
And yet they are upon my eyes,
And yet I am alive;
Before I see another day,
Oh let my body die away!

My fire is dead: it knew no pain;
Yet is it dead, and I remain:
All stiff with ice the ashes lie;
And they are dead, and I will die.
When I was well, I wished to live,
For clothes, for warmth, for food, and fire;
But they to me no joy can give,
No pleasure now, and no desire.
Then here contented will I lie
Alone, I cannot fear to die.

Alas! ye might have dragged me on
Another day, a single one!
Too soon I yielded to despair;
Why did ye listen to my prayer
When ye were gone my limb were stronger;
And oh, how grievously I rue,
That, afterward, a little longer,
My friends, I did not follow you!
For strong and without pain I lay,
Dear friends, when ye were gone away.

My Child! they gave thee to another,
A woman who was not thy mother.
When from my arms my Babe they took,
On me how strangely did he look !
Through his whole body something ran,
A most strange working did I see;
---As if he strove to be a man,
That he might pull the sledge for me:
And then he stretched his arm, how wild!
Oh mercy! like a helpless child.

My little joy! my little pride!
In two day more I must have died.
Then do not weep and grieve for me;
I feel I must have died with thee.
O wind, that o'er my head art flying
The way my friends their course did bend,
I should not feel the pain of dying,
Could I with thee a message end;
Too soon, my friend, ye went away;
For I had many thing to say.

I'll follow you across the snow;
Ye travel heavily and slow;
In spite of all my weary pain
I'll look upon your tent again.
---My fire is dead, and snowy white
The water which beside it stood:
The wolf has come to me to-night,
And he has stolen away my food.
Forever left alone am I;
Then wherefore should I fear to die ?

Young as I am, my course is run,
I shall not see another sun;
I cannot lift my limb to know
If they have any life or no.
My poor forsaken child, if I
For once could have thee close to me,
With happy heart I then would die,
And my last thought would happy be;
But thou, dear Babe, art far away,
Nor shall I see another day."
55,On the Departure of Sir Walter Scott from Abbotsford,".   A trouble, not of clouds, or weeping rain,
   Nor of the setting sun's pathetic light
   Engendered, hangs o'er Eildon's triple height:
   Spirits of Power, assembled there, complain
   For kindred Power departing from their sight;
   While Tweed, best pleased in chanting a blithe strain,
   Saddens his voice again, and yet again.
   Lift up your hearts, ye Mourners! for the might
   Of the whole world's good wishes with him goes;
  Blessings and prayers in nobler retinue
  Than sceptred king or laurelled conqueror knows,
  Follow this wondrous Potentate. Be true,
  Ye winds of ocean, and the midland sea,
  Wafting your Charge to soft Parthenope!"
56,On the Extinction of the Venetian Republic,".   Once did She hold the gorgeous east in fee;
   And was the safeguard of the west: the worth
   Of Venice did not fall below her birth,
   Venice, the eldest Child of Liberty.
   She was a maiden City, bright and free;
   No guile seduced, no force could violate;
   And, when she took unto herself a Mate,
   She must espouse the everlasting Sea.
   And what if she had seen those glories fade,
  Those titles vanish, and that strength decay;
  Yet shall some tribute of regret be paid
  When her long life hath reached its final day:
  Men are we, and must grieve when even the Shade
  Of that which once was great is passed away."
57,Resolution and Independence,". There was a roaring in the wind all night;
   The rain came heavily and fell in floods;
   But now the sun is rising calm and bright;
   The birds are singing in the distant woods;
   Over his own sweet voice the Stock-dove broods;
   The Jay makes answer as the Magpie chatters;
   And all the air is filled with pleasant noise of waters.
   All things that love the sun are out of doors;
   The sky rejoices in the morning's birth;
  The grass is bright with rain-drops;--on the moors
  The hare is running races in her mirth;
  And with her feet she from the plashy earth
  Raises a mist, that, glittering in the sun,
  Runs with her all the way, wherever she doth run.

  I was a Traveller then upon the moor;
  I saw the hare that raced about with joy;
  I heard the woods and distant waters roar;
  Or heard them not, as happy as a boy:
  The pleasant season did my heart employ:
  My old remembrances went from me wholly;
  And all the ways of men, so vain and melancholy.

  But, as it sometimes chanceth, from the might
  Of joys in minds that can no further go,
  As high as we have mounted in delight
  In our dejection do we sink as low;
  To me that morning did it happen so;
  And fears and fancies thick upon me came;
  Dim sadness--and blind thoughts, I knew not, nor could name.

  I heard the sky-lark warbling in the sky;
  And I bethought me of the playful hare:
  Even such a happy Child of earth am I;
  Even as these blissful creatures do I fare;
  Far from the world I walk, and from all care;
  But there may come another day to me--
  Solitude, pain of heart, distress, and poverty.

  My whole life I have lived in pleasant thought,
  As if life's business were a summer mood;
  As if all needful things would come unsought
  To genial faith, still rich in genial good;
  But how can He expect that others should
  Build for him, sow for him, and at his call
  Love him, who for himself will take no heed at all?

  I thought of Chatterton, the marvellous Boy,
  The sleepless Soul that perished in his pride;
  Of Him who walked in glory and in joy
  Following his plough, along the mountain-side:
  By our own spirits are we deified:
  We Poets in our youth begin in gladness;
  But thereof come in the end despondency and madness.

  Now, whether it were by peculiar grace,
  A leading from above, a something given,
  Yet it befell that, in this lonely place,
  When I with these untoward thoughts had striven,
  Beside a pool bare to the eye of heaven
  I saw a Man before me unawares:
  The oldest man he seemed that ever wore grey hairs.

  As a huge stone is sometimes seen to lie
  Couched on the bald top of an eminence;
  Wonder to all who do the same espy,
   By what means it could thither come, and whence;
  So that it seems a thing endued with sense:
  Like a sea-beast crawled forth, that on a shelf
  Of rock or sand reposeth, there to sun itself;

  Such seemed this Man, not all alive nor dead,
  Nor all asleep--in his extreme old age:
  His body was bent double, feet and head
  Coming together in life's pilgrimage;
  As if some dire constraint of pain, or rage
  Of sickness felt by him in times long past,
  A more than human weight upon his frame had cast.

  Himself he propped, limbs, body, and pale face,
  Upon a long grey staff of shaven wood:
  And, still as I drew near with gentle pace,
  Upon the margin of that moorish flood
  Motionless as a cloud the old Man stood,
  That heareth not the loud winds when they call,
  And moveth all together, if it move at all.

  At length, himself unsettling, he the pond
  Stirred with his staff, and fixedly did look
  Upon the muddy water, which he conned,
  As if he had been reading in a book:
  And now a stranger's privilege I took;
  And, drawing to his side, to him did say,
  ""This morning gives us promise of a glorious day.""

  A gentle answer did the old Man make,
  In courteous speech which forth he slowly drew:
  And him with further words I thus bespake,
  ""What occupation do you there pursue?
  This is a lonesome place for one like you.""
  Ere he replied, a flash of mild surprise
  Broke from the sable orbs of his yet-vivid eyes.

  His words came feebly, from a feeble chest,
  But each in solemn order followed each,
  With something of a lofty utterance drest--
  Choice word and measured phrase, above the reach
  Of ordinary men; a stately speech;
  Such as grave Livers do in Scotland use,
  Religious men, who give to God and man their dues.

  He told, that to these waters he had come
 To gather leeches, being old and poor:
 Employment hazardous and wearisome!
 And he had many hardships to endure:
 From pond to pond he roamed, from moor to moor;
 Housing, with God's good help, by choice or chance;
 And in this way he gained an honest maintenance.


 The old Man still stood talking by my side;
 But now his voice to me was like a stream
 Scarce heard; nor word from word could I divide;
 And the whole body of the Man did seem
 Like one whom I had met with in a dream;
 Or like a man from some far region sent,
 To give me human strength, by apt admonishment.


 My former thoughts returned: the fear that kills;
 And hope that is unwilling to be fed;
 Cold, pain, and labour, and all fleshly ills;
 And mighty Poets in their misery dead.
 --Perplexed, and longing to be comforted,
 My question eagerly did I renew,
 ""How is it that you live, and what is it you do?""


 He with a smile did then his words repeat;
 And said that, gathering leeches, far and wide
 He travelled; stirring thus about his feet
 The waters of the pools where they abide.
 ""Once I could meet with them on every side;
 But they have dwindled long by slow decay;
 Yet still I persevere, and find them where I may.""


 While he was talking thus, the lonely place,
 The old Man's shape, and speech--all troubled me:
 In my mind's eye I seemed to see him pace
 About the weary moors continually,
 Wandering about alone and silently.
 While I these thoughts within myself pursued,
 He, having made a pause, the same discourse renewed.


 And soon with this he other matter blended,
 Cheerfully uttered, with demeanour kind,
 But stately in the main; and, when he ended,
 I could have laughed myself to scorn to find
 In that decrepit Man so firm a mind.
 ""God,"" said I, ""be my help and stay secure;
 I'll think of the Leech-gatherer on the lonely moor!"""
