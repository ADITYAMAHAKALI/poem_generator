pain,"Today I was thinking about sorrow;
Probably the only thing I am expert at.
Spend so much time with it;
Shouldn't have any problem with that.

But you know, sometimes it hurt ;
Sometimes it pain.
To get a relase from it ;
I don't know what I have to gain.


Whatever, I still love tragedy;
In real life that's how most stories end;
Just like think about betrayal,
It always comes from your closest friends."
The Rain of Mind,"Finally the rain has come out from its home,
Didn't know it was needed this much.
Days are cooler now,
Who doesn't like a weather such.

It's one of the best creation,
Helps us in a lot of way.
Gives every one a sigh of relief,
Like after darkness we have seen a bright ray.

It clears all the garbage and dust,
Makes the environment look fresh.
Like mother nature is very happy,
So she decides to wear a new dress.

Why don't we have such creation inside us ?
That can just work like rain.
Carries all the sorrow ,all the guild,
And  releases us from our mental pain. 

Do you know anything about the rain of mind ?
Please inform me too.
I also want to get relief from all the traumas,
And live this life as we should do..."
Everything will be alright,"So what! if all I have is my suffering,
I am still so much alive ,ain't I ?
Isn't that good enough,
To carry on, hoping for a better time!

So what! if I think too much and sleep too less,
I still have to try, I haven't I !
Maybe someday I'll have all the luck,
perhaps I'll succeed the next time!

I won't pretend to be happy,So what! if all I have is my suffering,
I am still so much alive ,ain't I ?
Isn't that good enough,
To carry on, hoping for a better time!

So what! if I think too much and sleep too less,
I still have to try, I haven't I !
Maybe someday I'll have all the luck,
perhaps I'll succeed the next time!

I won't pretend to be happy,
I'm miserable, indeed I am,
But I didn't grow up,
To sit up one day wanting to die,
I know I am good enough,
Everything will be alright."
THE BEST DREAM OF ME,"I have thousands dreams ;
But I priorities a few.
This one is special ;
cause it's about you.

There will be a day ;
when we will be together.
Walking beside , holding hands ;
And nothing can make us bother. 

No care about world , No tension ;
There will be just me and you.
Suddenly I will stop , Bend on my knees
And again I will tell you "" I Love You"" ."
Choice,"I choose to love you in silence…
For in silence I find no rejection,

I choose to love you in loneliness…
For in loneliness no one owns you but me,

I choose to adore you from a distance…
For distance will shield me from pain,

I choose to kiss you in the wind…
For the wind is gentler than my lips,

I choose to hold you in my dreams…
For in my dreams, you have no end"
The day you came,"
You know, there are 365 days in a year,
But for me few of them are worth.
This day is special,
Cause it's November 4th.

People wondering what's special about this day,
Hold on I'm just going to share.
Why it's so important to me ?
Why do I so much care?

But ,you know the reason right?
You have to, it's your claim.
This was exactly the day on earth,
When a beautiful angel came.

Well ,I am done here,
Almost told everything needed to say.
But before ending this a last line for you,
I wish you a very very happy birthday."
